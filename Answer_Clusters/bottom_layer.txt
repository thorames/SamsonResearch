4153fe71-ad4a-4ef0-8c73-e1c1073916c1,Convective instability occurs when a layer of air rises. When it rises, it becomes less stable as the difference between the top and bottom of the layer increases. Because of this change, the top of the layer will cool by the dry adiabatic rate, whereas the bottom will cool at the moist adiabatic rate. Thus, the layer is unsaturated at its top and saturated near its bottom, becoming convectively unstable.
f1e294d6-310c-42bd-a022-94350c308c4a,The conditions that lead to convective instability are that the saturated bottom layer of air cools at the moist adiabatic rate and the unsaturated air cools at the dry adiabatic rate. The layer on the bottom is lifted which causes it to become less stable. Then the combination of an unsaturated layer and a saturated layer on top causes it to become convectively unstable.
6baa13e4-2991-4088-b437-9b242fbbe3e9,A layer of air that is warm and humid at the surface and dry, cool air that is above it (~ 900 mb) begins to rise and cool. The bottom of the layer cools at the moist adiabatic rate and the top cools at the dry adiabatic rate thus causing a very steep environmental lapse rate between the bottom and the top of the layer causing instability
05be77b8-6aa5-4200-b328-f7212b1d687c,When the bottom of a layer is saturated and the top of the layer is unsaturated, and we lift the layer of air up into the atmosphere, the bottom of the layer will cool at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, but the top of the layer will cool at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. This produces a convectively unstable layer in the atmosphere.
75279907-3023-46f7-8261-1aaebbcb26f6,Convective instability happens when an unsaturated layer or air towards the top and a saturated layer of air near the bottom are lifted. Since the bottom layer cools at the moist adiabatic lapse rate and the top layer cools at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, the moist air meets the dry air, creating an unstable atmosphere.
987cca35-3575-4d28-8820-347fe495dec1,The bottom layer of a cloud is saturated while its top layer is unsaturated. As a result, the bottom layer rises at the moist adiabatic lapse rate while the top layer rises at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, causing the cloud to become very unstable and buoyant. The state of this cloud is convectively unstable.
1bf81583-9038-423b-a72f-eb4d4af433fb,Convective instability is instability caused by the lifting of an air layer. The top of the layer rises farther than the bottom of the layer, getting colder and changing the layer from isothermically stable to convectively unstable.
8d893e34-3048-415a-b88a-d3c959d1516c,Convective instability is caused when the layer at the top is unsaturated and the layer at the bottom is nearly saturated. This causes an inversion and then the lapse rates become steeper and more unstable.
7f0a2b08-91f6-4c63-8071-190e0672b880,The top layer has to go further than the bottom. Nature of the atmosphere. If you lift any layer, it'll become less stable. A layer unsaturated at it top and saturated near its bottom causes temp. change
a675c3c6-6c2a-4c2f-b8ed-96fa6a356f47,When there is warm moist air underneath and cool dry air above and the two layers are lifted together. The different layers change at different rates that lead it to be convectively unstable.
