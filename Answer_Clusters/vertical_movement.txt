96ba7a4d-c926-4e9f-b67d-ca66fd635684,convective instability or stability of an air mass refers to its ability to resist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes vertical movement difficult, and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear.
30b8d083-ee94-4dac-8cfa-e7c33d216df3,kdjlask to its ability to resist vertical motion. A stable atmosphere makes vertical movement difficult, and small vertical disturbances dampen out and disappear.
84551c98-f7bf-45f4-afda-bd416379217b,so convected instability is the ability to resist vertical motion of the air so i would say that the cause of this would be warm air forced to move vertically.
