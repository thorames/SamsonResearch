b8fafa12-0a29-440d-abbf-41502ba60983,Convective instability is caused when the upper layer of air is unsaturated and the lower layer of air is unsaturated. Air becomes less stable as it rises, so as convection occurs, the air becomes less and less stable.
7dfe3609-4994-4de1-b93b-60b8a604df76,When an air parcel has the conditions so that when lifted, it becomes more unstable. It can be saturated at the bottom and unsaturated at the top, causing it to be unstable when lifted.
98916953-ae39-435e-a234-4fedb1365fd7,near the surface, air is saturated. As it rises it becomes unsaturated and then continues to rise leading to instability
c41efc31-78db-4099-8866-e1882e75441a,Unsaturated near the top and saturated at the bottom, meaning there is also a temperature difference between the two.
07f0a4a0-5e45-499d-9753-6f7440614bdc,convective instablility is caused by an unsaturated at the ground but saturated up higher in the atmosphere.
eb4d4d94-ad9b-4ab4-9893-4463e8fdca36,When the layer of unsaturated air at the top and saturated air at the bottom meet due to the adiabatic rate
81eb1fe3-00da-49ae-87b4-a63ea7d1f621,When you get saturated air at the top, and unsaturated air on the bottom.
1d0578d3-78b4-493d-82c3-632ca970622b,The top of the air parcel is unsaturated while the bottom is saturated
6a2d4eb4-8e39-4da9-80a7-e23fef747376,When the air is unsaturated at the bottom and saturated at its top
0d0404cb-8040-48ce-9afd-aa3ec234e523,The air at the top is unsaturated and the air below saturated.
ef71e2e5-ff82-4e34-b283-c2fb2b22aa75,Unsaturated air at the top and saturated air at the bottom
df6ed85c-7f42-423c-a962-7f85aacbddfc,When the top is saturated and the bottom is unsaturated
dff0ef0c-83b9-48a4-a864-0c9dde072385,Unsaturation at top and saturation at bottom.
a0e92516-9d0e-4383-b1d4-c3dc8fcb0086,unsaturated air above and saturated air below
37319bc4-f91d-4e35-bf9a-7b4ea0d126b8,unsaturated at top saturated an bottom
22598e22-7789-49ba-8c4f-c3663995ef14,bottom is unsaturated
