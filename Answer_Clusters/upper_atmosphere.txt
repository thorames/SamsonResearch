fc3a4696-3509-4a9b-934d-4ce322beb6d8,unsaturated in the upper atmosphere (top) rises at DALR and saturated near the surface (bottom) rises at MALR creating a steeper temp inversion
cecb010f-bd4e-4849-a214-573b05ad71b6,having a saturated base and unsaturated upper atmosphere. The air cools at the moist, then dry adiabatic rate making it convectively instable
30afed32-2fea-4f61-a5bc-2dd742e27bdb,the atmosphere is convectively unstable when there are two zones in the atmosphere that vary in temperature that are very close together
7801e40c-111e-423a-9a83-feaf410250b4,The conditions that lead to convective instability are when there is cooler air in the upper atmosphere and warmer air at the surface.
86469f46-c700-4086-a334-672479f128d3,Instability in the upper atmosphere do to heating of the earth/ lower atmostphere while the u\\air aloft is cold
3d9cf3ef-633e-4722-9af1-86bfefb966a9,Different wind direction for surface and upper atmosphere as well as different temperatures and moisture levels
302fc6ad-0108-43a7-bc7b-cd9dd5fbf8e9,Rapid temperature change and lower temperatures higher in the atmosphere. Also strong winds?
5bd84ec0-14fd-468f-ae79-8fef83309f8e,The unperfect system of the atmosphere means convection isn't going to work perfectly.
7777ab3b-a3a8-4ea3-9b31-e5980d357c94,The air is not saturated leading to a temperature inversion in the lower atmosphere
