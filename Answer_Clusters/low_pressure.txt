13d563af-09d8-4aec-9dbf-d7cb3294cf39,As the temperature decreases, the pressure increases, but near the surface the pressure and temperature reaction is inverted, creating a difference between dry and moist rates
3a067bf3-e35b-4a06-a868-c264ad0211f6,when a low and a high pressure system mix together and form a pressure system that is unstable. Heat rises from the ground and flows toward the low pressure system?
933a885e-38ee-43a1-b55a-e2431d505c7f,It means that the atmosphere is convectively unstable because of the high to low pressure gradient\n
a32b4289-3fe3-4df9-a55c-72ec6c0e71bc,high pressure and low pressure systems coming together and pushing against one another\n
