If you have unstable air on the ground it will become less stable as it rises because the bottom is saturated cools at the moist adiabatic rate and the top of the layer is in the dry zone which cools at the dry adiabatic rate and they meet each other and become even less stable.
5d4f0aaa-e3e5-4917-917d-7f31f8347148,Conditions where the ground is near saturated and the layer above it is dry will lead to convective instability. The air near the ground will rise and cool at the moist adiabatic rate and the air above it will cool at the dry adiabatic rate causing a bigger temperature difference which is less stable.
bc1fb87b-17eb-4144-854e-135a38a6fae2,warm and muggy near the surface, air is nearly saturated. Then at a change in pressure in the top layer it is cold and dry. Air is drying a moist adiabatic lapse rate at surface but dry adiabatic lapse right in upper layer, where they meet in the base for convective instability.
454d8409-27e5-43b5-a416-f59997a86b2a,Convective instability is when air is lifted and becomes less stable with altitude. There are two layers of air at the bottom. The first is warm and muggy, which dries at the moist adiabatic lapse rate. The cool layer is dries at dry adiabatic lapse rate.
5dcd4367-c896-4a75-a1e9-a05cf6176915,(Nearly) saturated air near the ground (hot/muggy) cools at the moist adiabatic rate and unsaturated air above (cold/dry and inversion) cools at the dry adiabatic rate
