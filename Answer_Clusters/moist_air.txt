97d11de0-192a-4ed5-b1bb-e74d2efec758,When air rises, moist air cools at a lower rate than dry air. That is, for the same upwards vertical movement and starting temperature, a parcel of moist air will be warmer than a parcel of dry air. This is because of the condensation of water vapor in the air parcel due to expansion cooling. As water vapor condenses, latent heat is released into the air parcel. Moist air has more water vapor than dry air, so more latent heat is released into the parcel of moist air as it rises. Dry air does not have as much water vapor, therefore dry air cools at a higher rate with vertical movement than moist air. As a result of the latent heat that is released during water vapor condensation, moist air has a relatively lower adiabatic lapse rate than dry air. This makes moist air generally less stable than dry air (see convective available potential energy). The dry adiabatic lapse rate (for unsaturated air) is 3 째C (5.4 째F) per 1,000 vertical feet (300 m). The moist adiabatic lapse rate varies from 1.1 to 2.8 째C (2.0 to 5.0 째F) per 1,000 vertical feet (300 m).
b991214c-fedd-47f1-a631-ca7f903b7dd3,It starts with an unstable atmosphere, with warm, moist air below and cool, dry air above. As the air rises, the air from the bottom cools at the moist adiabatic rate and the top of the layer cools at the dry adiabatic rate. This causes the difference to become even steeper in the upper atmosphere and therefore even more unstable.
ad7abb78-1ca3-486c-b80a-a7a753363750,Warm, moist, nearly saturated air at the surface rises to a higher altitude/lower pressure at the moist adiabatic lapse rate. Cool, dry air above the surface layer of warm, moist air rises at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. This causes a very steep temperature difference at altitude, so a storm will form and grow quickly
f7faa93d-3725-4554-b94b-ba3623da4c48,the air near surface is warm and moist, the ais above the ground is cold and dry. when moving this layer of air within the same pressure difference, the air at the ground go at moist adiabatic rate, and air at top go at moist adiabatic rate. the air at top also goes more distance. the lapes rate is increased
cc6d9ca0-e6e1-406d-9d4f-5a00136516f5,There is a layer of unsaturated air at the top of a layer of saturated air, so the air near the bottom is cooling at the moist lapse rate while the air above is cooling at the dry lapse rate. This causes a steeper lapse rate higher in the atmosphere which leads to much less stable air.
65212b74-a914-4fa7-8a86-d21a3943cebd,Convective instability occurs when there is warm, moist air at the surface and cold, dry air above. When forced to rise, the warm, moist air has a steeper lapse rate, and as the air rises, it becomes even more buoyant and less stable.

045b8a36-2477-41a3-8b42-33b55c33eee6,We need very moist, hot air at low altitudes, and cold, dry air at high altitudes. Then the air on the way down will cool at the dry adiabatic lapse rate while the air on the way up will cool at the moist adiabatic lapse rate.
