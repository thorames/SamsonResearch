How do you feel convective instability may play a role in the formation of intense thunderstorms?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Convective instability is brought about by the lifting of a stable layer whose surface is humid and whose top is dry.  Convective instability is associated with the development of severe storms because these types of moisture conditions are often found in thunderstorm environments."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56301f2213a2bd0b0069e3db"}, "Question": {"S": "Downdrafts spread throughout a thunderstorm during the ____ stage."}, "Answer": {"S": "B) dissipating"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) cumulus"}, {"S": "B) dissipating"}, {"S": "C) precipitating"}, {"S": "D) developing"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56301ee113a2bd0b0069e3d5"}, "Question": {"S": "Severe thunderstorms are different from air-mass thunderstorms in that severe thunderstorms:"}, "Answer": {"S": "E) have a tilted updraft in the mature stage"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) contain thunder and lightning"}, {"S": "B) have an anvil"}, {"S": "C) contain hail"}, {"S": "D) have a strong updraft and downdraft"}, {"S": "E) have a tilted updraft in the mature stage"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "705"}, "Question": {"S": "Describe the atmospheric conditions at the surface and aloft that are necessary for the development of most supercell thunderstorms. (Include in your answer the role that the lowlevel jet plays in the rotating updraft.)"}, "Answer": {"S": "In a region where there is strong vertical wind shear as might be caused with the existence of a low-level jet the thunderstorm may form in such a way that the outflow of cold air from the downdraft never undercuts the updraft. In such a storm the wind shear may be so strong as to create horizontal spin which when tilted into the updraft causes it to rotate. A large long-lasting thunderstorm with a single violently rotating updraft is called a supercell. It is the rotating aspect of the supercell that can lead to the formation of tornadoes."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56301e2c13a2bd0b0069e3c4"}, "Question": {"S": "Air mass thunderstorms only last about one hour and begin to dissipate when:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) when the downdraft spreads throughout the cloud and cuts off the updraft"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) lightning neutralizes all the electrical charge in the cloud"}, {"S": "B) when all the precipitation particles in the cloud turn to ice"}, {"S": "C) when the downdraft spreads throughout the cloud and cuts off the updraft"}, {"S": "D) when solar heating at the ground begins to decrease"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563021b613a2bd0b0069e410"}, "Question": {"S": "The leading edge of a thunderstorm's cold downdraft is known as a:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) gust front"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) downburst"}, {"S": "B) squall line"}, {"S": "C) gust front"}, {"S": "D) dry line"}, {"S": "E) microburst"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5630223313a2bd0b0069e41c"}, "Question": {"S": "A small thunderstorm cloud with virga falling out of its base and blowing dust at the ground could warn of a severe hazard to an airplane because:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) this could indicate an intense downdraft or microburst"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) this could be the first indication of a tornado"}, {"S": "B) it is likely that hail will soon begin to fall"}, {"S": "C) this could indicate an intense downdraft or microburst"}, {"S": "D) the airplane could be struck by lightning"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "704"}, "Question": {"S": "How does the cell in an ordinary cell thunderstorm differ from the cell in a supercell thunderstorm?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The updraft in a supercell thunderstorm is longer-lasting and rotates."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}]}}}
