If the different versions agree fairly well a forecaster can place a high degree of confidence in the forecast. A low degree of confidence means that the models do not agree.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class CLIMATE102_190923", "main": "What atmospheric conditions cause the forecaster to issue a severe thunderstorm watch?
