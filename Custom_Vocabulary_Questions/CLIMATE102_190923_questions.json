If the different versions agree fairly well a forecaster can place a high degree of confidence in the forecast. A low degree of confidence means that the models do not agree."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "793"}, "Question": {"S": "What atmospheric conditions cause the forecaster to issue a severe thunderstorm watch? What would be necessary for the same forecaster to issue a tornado warning?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Severe thunderstorm watch: CAPE values of 2500-3500. Tornado warning: a tornado has been spotted either visually or by Doppler radar."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "789"}, "Question": {"S": "Do all accurate forecasts show skill? Explain."}, "Answer": {"S": "Forecasts show skill when they are more accurate than a forecast utilizing only persistence or climatology."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563025cd13a2bd0b0069e47b"}, "Question": {"S": "A weather warning indicates that:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) hazardous weather is either imminent or occurring within the forecast area"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) the atmospheric conditions are favorable for hazardous weather over a particular region"}, {"S": "B) hazardous weather is either imminent or occurring within the forecast area"}, {"S": "C) hazardous weather is likely to occur within the forecast area during the next 24 hours"}, {"S": "D) hazardous weather is frequently observed in a particular region"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "791"}, "Question": {"S": "Do monthly and seasonal forecasts make specific predictions of rain or snow? Explain."}, "Answer": {"S": "No. These forecasts called outlooks predict average weather conditions for a particular month or a season. These are not forecasts in the strict sense but rather an overview of how average precipitation and temperature patterns may compare with normal conditions."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "834"}, "Question": {"S": "What atmospheric conditions would the forecaster look for when predicting: "}, "Answer": {"S": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)"}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5630270813a2bd0b0069e49a"}, "Question": {"S": "The least accurate forecast method of predicting the weather two days into the future during changeable weather conditions is usually the:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) persistence forecast"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) trend method"}, {"S": "B) persistence forecast"}, {"S": "C) analogue method"}, {"S": "D) prediction by weather types"}, {"S": "E) numerical weather prediction"}]}}}]}}}
