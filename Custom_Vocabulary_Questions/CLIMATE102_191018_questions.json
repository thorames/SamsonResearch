In September the region where hurricanes are most likely to form stretches westward into the Gulf of Mexico and northward along the Atlantic seaboard.  Typical hurricane paths take them into the central Gulf of Mexico for northeastward out over the Atlantic.  Should an Atlantic hurricane track close to the coastline it could make landfall anywhere from Florida to the mid-Atlantic states.
