A strong pressure gradient will occur when the central pressure of the storm is exceptionally low which can occur is exceptionally strong divergence occurs over the cyclone.  To get a strong divergence requires a strong jet stream which in turn requires an intense temperature gradient at the surface.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 2 for Class CLIMATE102_190927", "main": "What causes the wind to blow?", "answer": "Wind will blow if there is a gradient in pressure in the horizontal.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 3 for Class CLIMATE102_190927", "main": "If the flow of air into a surface low pressure area is greater than the divergence of air aloft the surface pressure in the center of the low will:", "answer": "A) increase", "mcq": [{"option": "A) increase", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) decrease", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) remain the same", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) deepen", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class CLIMATE102_190927", "main": "How does a steep (or strong) pressure gradient appear on a weather map?", "answer": "A strong pressure gradient is represented as isobars close together.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class CLIMATE102_190927", "main": "Explain how converging air and diverging air forms at the surface and aloft.", "answer": "(a) Surface air converges towards the center of a low and diverges from the center of a high.
