A strong pressure gradient will occur when the central pressure of the storm is exceptionally low which can occur is exceptionally strong divergence occurs over the cyclone.  To get a strong divergence requires a strong jet stream which in turn requires an intense temperature gradient at the surface."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "431"}, "Question": {"S": "What causes the wind to blow?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Wind will blow if there is a gradient in pressure in the horizontal."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563012a413a2bd0b0069e2ba"}, "Question": {"S": "If the flow of air into a surface low pressure area is greater than the divergence of air aloft the surface pressure in the center of the low will:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) increase"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) increase"}, {"S": "B) decrease"}, {"S": "C) remain the same"}, {"S": "D) deepen"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "558"}, "Question": {"S": "How does a steep (or strong) pressure gradient appear on a weather map?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A strong pressure gradient is represented as isobars close together."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "673"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain how converging air and diverging air forms at the surface and aloft."}, "Answer": {"S": "(a) Surface air converges towards the center of a low and diverges from the center of a high.    (b) a region of converging air usually forms on the west side of an upper-level trough and a region of diverging air forms on the east side."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "939"}, "Question": {"S": "The pressure gradient force is directed from higher pressure toward lower pressure:"}, "Answer": {"S": "E) at all places on earth"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) only at the equator"}, {"S": "B) at all places on earth except for the equator"}, {"S": "C) only in the Northern Hemisphere"}, {"S": "D) only in the Southern Hemisphere"}, {"S": "E) at all places on earth"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "985"}, "Question": {"S": "Developing low pressure areas generally have ____ air near the surface and ____ air aloft."}, "Answer": {"S": "A) converging, diverging"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) converging, diverging"}, {"S": "B) diverging, converging"}, {"S": "C) converging, converging"}, {"S": "D) diverging, diverging"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "719"}, "Question": {"S": "Why do the majority of tornadoes move from southwest to northeast?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Tornadoes are associated with supercell thunderstorms which are caused in part by strong divergence aloft.

Unless divergence exists above the low it will fill in quickly and dissipate."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}]}}}
