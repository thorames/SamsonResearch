How does upwelling influence the formation of fog?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Northerly winds along the West Coast cause upwelling. As the deeper colder water rises to the surface it cools the air directly above the water. Fog commonly occurs as the surface air cools to its dew point temperature."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e8e8c02cba50b007693fc"}, "Question": {"S": "In the general circulation of the atmosphere one would find the region called the doldrums:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) at the equator"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) near 30\u00ac\u221e latitude"}, {"S": "B) at the equator"}, {"S": "C) at the poles"}, {"S": "D) near 60\u00ac\u221e latitude"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5641516a2b15ed0b00ec3845"}, "Question": {"S": "Cyclonic flow means ____ in either the Northern or Southern Hemisphere."}, "Answer": {"S": "C) circulation around a low pressure center"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) clockwise wind flow"}, {"S": "B) counterclockwise flow"}, {"S": "C) circulation around a low pressure center"}, {"S": "D) circulation around a high pressure center"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "917"}, "Question": {"S": "In terms of the three-cell model of the general circulation areas of surface low pressure should be found at:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) the equator and 60\u00ac\u221e latitude"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) the equator and the poles"}, {"S": "B) the equator and 30\u00ac\u221e latitude"}, {"S": "C) the equator and 60\u00ac\u221e latitude"}, {"S": "D) 30\u00ac\u221e latitude and 60\u00ac\u221e latitude"}, {"S": "E) 30&\u00ac\u221e latitude and the poles"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e8fda02cba50b00769419"}, "Question": {"S": "According to the three-cell general circulation model at the equator we would not expect to find:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) a ridge of high pressure"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) the ITCZ"}, {"S": "B) a ridge of high pressure"}, {"S": "C) cumuliform clouds"}, {"S": "D) light winds"}, {"S": "E) heavy showers"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e927e02cba50b0076944d"}, "Question": {"S": "Which below is not an assumption of the single-cell model of the general circulation of the atmosphere?"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) the earth rotates once in 24 hours"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) the earth's surface is covered with water"}, {"S": "B) the earth rotates once in 24 hours"}, {"S": "C) the sun is always overhead at the equator"}, {"S": "D) none of the above"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "924"}, "Question": {"S": "If the coastline shown in the figure below is located in the Southern Hemisphere then upwelling along the coast would occur when the wind blows from the:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) south"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) north"}, {"S": "B) south"}, {"S": "C) east"}, {"S": "D) west"}]}}}]}}}
