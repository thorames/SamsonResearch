The tropical disturbance becomes a tropical depression when the winds increase to between 20 and 34 knots and several closed isobars appear about its center on a surface weather map. When the isobars are packed together and the winds are between 35 and 64 knots the tropical depression becomes a tropical storm. The tropical storm is classified as a hurricane only when its winds exceed 64 knots (74 miles/hour)."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5630385ad72ccd0b00acec58"}, "Question": {"S": "On the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale a hurricane with winds in excess of 155 mi/hr (135 knots) and a central pressure of 910 mb (26.87 in.) would be classified as a category ____ hurricane."}, "Answer": {"S": "E) 5"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) 1"}, {"S": "B) 2"}, {"S": "C) 3"}, {"S": "D) 4"}, {"S": "E) 5"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "770"}, "Question": {"S": "Why do most hurricanes move westward over tropical waters?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The form between the equator and 30 degrees  latitude in the trade winds which generally blow from the east."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "757"}, "Question": {"S": "Most waterspouts would fall into which category of the Fujita scale?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) F0"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) F0"}, {"S": "B) F1"}, {"S": "C) F2"}, {"S": "D) F4 or F5"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "755"}, "Question": {"S": "What conditions at the surface and aloft are necessary for hurricane development?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Hurricanes form over tropical waters where the winds are light the humidity is high in a deep layer extending up through the troposphere and the surface water temperature is warm typically 26.5 degrees C (80 degrees F) or greater over a vast area.      For a mass of unorganized thunderstorms to develop into a hurricane the surface winds must converge. In the Northern Hemisphere converging air spins counterclockwise about an area of surface low pressure. Rotation will not develop on the equator where the Coriolis force is zero hurricanes form in tropical regions usually between 5 degrees  and 20 degrees  latitude."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "976"}, "Question": {"S": "The first three stages of a developing hurricane are (from first stage to third stage):"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) tropical disturbance, tropical depression, tropical storm"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) tropical disturbance, tropical storm, typhoon"}, {"S": "B) tropical depression, tropical disturbance, tropical storm"}, {"S": "C) tropical disturbance, tropical depression, tropical storm"}, {"S": "D) cyclone, typhoon, tropical storm"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563035e2d72ccd0b00acec18"}, "Question": {"S": "Storms that form in the tropics are given names when:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) they reach tropical storm strength"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) they reach tropical storm strength"}, {"S": "B) they become fully developed hurricanes"}, {"S": "C) they approach to within 250 miles of land"}, {"S": "D) rotation becomes visible on a satellite photograph"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56303a3cd72ccd0b00acec83"}, "Question": {"S": "Just before a storm becomes a fully developed hurricane it is in the ____ stage.
