Why would you not expect to observe a geostrophic wind at the equator?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A geostrophic wind is a wind caused by a balance of pressure gradient force and Coriolis force.  There cannot be a geostrophic balance at the equator as there is no Coriolis force there."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e933302cba50b0076945e"}, "Question": {"S": "The reversal of the positions of surface high and low pressure at opposite ends of the Pacific Ocean is called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) the Southern Oscillation"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) El Ni\u221a\u00b1o"}, {"S": "B) the Southern Oscillation"}, {"S": "C) upwelling"}, {"S": "D) La Ni\u221a\u00b1a"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "564155052b15ed0b00ec389c"}, "Question": {"S": "A wind blowing at a constant speed parallel to straight line isobars with the pressure gradient force (PGF) and the Coriolis force in balance is called a:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) geostrophic wind"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) gradient wind"}, {"S": "B) meridional wind"}, {"S": "C) geostrophic wind"}, {"S": "D) cyclostrophic wind"}, {"S": "E) zonal wind"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "974"}, "Question": {"S": "Hurricane winds rotate in a clockwise direction:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) in the Southern Hemisphere only"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) in the Northern Hemisphere only"}, {"S": "B) in the Southern Hemisphere only"}, {"S": "C) in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres"}, {"S": "D) in neither hemisphere"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "796"}, "Question": {"S": "What are the conditions over the tropical eastern and central Pacific Ocean during the phenomenon known as El Nino? La Nina?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Under ordinary conditions higher pressure over the southeastern Pacific and lower pressure near Indonesia produces easterly trade winds along the equator. These winds promote upwelling and cooler ocean water in the eastern Pacific while warmer water prevails in the western Pacific. The trades are part of a circulation (called the Walker circulation) that typically finds rising air and heavy rain over the western Pacific and sinking air and generally dry weather over the eastern Pacific. When the trades are exceptionally strong water along the equator in the eastern Pacific becomes quite cool. This cool event is called La Nina. During El Nino conditions atmospheric pressure decreases over the eastern Pacific and rises over the western Pacific. This change in pressure causes the trades to weaken or reverse direction. This situation enhances the countercurrent that carries warm water from the west over a vast region of the eastern tropical Pacific. The thermocline which separates the warm water of the upper ocean from the cold water below changes as the ocean conditions change from non-El Nino to El Nino."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e8c5b02cba50b007693c8"}, "Question": {"S": "In the Northern Hemisphere ocean currents in the Atlantic and the Pacific move in a generally circular pattern.
