La Nina?", "answer": "Under ordinary conditions higher pressure over the southeastern Pacific and lower pressure near Indonesia produces easterly trade winds along the equator. These winds promote upwelling and cooler ocean water in the eastern Pacific while warmer water prevails in the western Pacific. The trades are part of a circulation (called the Walker circulation) that typically finds rising air and heavy rain over the western Pacific and sinking air and generally dry weather over the eastern Pacific. When the trades are exceptionally strong water along the equator in the eastern Pacific becomes quite cool. This cool event is called La Nina. During El Nino conditions atmospheric pressure decreases over the eastern Pacific and rises over the western Pacific. This change in pressure causes the trades to weaken or reverse direction. This situation enhances the countercurrent that carries warm water from the west over a vast region of the eastern tropical Pacific. The thermocline which separates the warm water of the upper ocean from the cold water below changes as the ocean conditions change from non-El Nino to El Nino.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 6 for Class CLIMATE102_191011", "main": "In the Northern Hemisphere ocean currents in the Atlantic and the Pacific move in a generally circular pattern.
