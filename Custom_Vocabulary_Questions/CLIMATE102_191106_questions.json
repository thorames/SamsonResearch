As liquid droplets collide with a hailstone they freeze on contact and release latent heat. This process keeps the surface of the hailstone warmer than that of the surrounding ice crystals. When the warmer hailstone comes in contact with a colder ice crystal an important phenomenon occurs: There is a net transfer of positive ions (charged molecules) from the warmer object to the colder object. Hence the hailstone (larger warmer particle) becomes negatively charged and the ice crystal (smaller cooler particle) positively charged as the positive ions are incorporated into the ice crystal.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 2 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "How does negative cloud-to-ground lightning differ from positive cloud-to-ground lightning?", "answer": "The typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash is called negative cloud-to-ground-lightning because the stroke carries negative charges from the cloud to the ground.  About 90 percent of all cloud-to-ground lightning is negative.  However when the base of the cloud is positively charged and the ground negatively charged a positive cloud-to-ground lightning flash may result.  Positive lightning most common with severe thunderstorms has the potential to cause more damage because it generates a much higher current level and its flash lasts for a longer duration than negative lightning.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 3 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "Electrons:", "answer": "A) are negatively charged", "mcq": [{"option": "A) are negatively charged", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) are positively charged", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) carry no charge", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) can carry either positive or negative charge", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "Precipitation with the greatest size (diameter) is:", "answer": "C) a hailstone", "mcq": [{"option": "A) the snow pellet", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) the snow grain", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) a hailstone", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) sleet", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}, {"option": "E) a rain drop", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 5}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "The upper part of a thunderstorm cloud is normally ____ charged and the middle and lower parts are ____ charged.", "answer": "D) positively, negatively", "mcq": [{"option": "A) negatively, negatively", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) negatively, positively", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) positively, positively", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) positively, negatively", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 6 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "A discharge of electricity from or within a thunderstorm is called:", "answer": "B) lightning", "mcq": [{"option": "A) static electricity", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) lightning", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) a downburst", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) St. Elmo's fire", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}, {"option": "E) an atmospheric arc", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 5}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 7 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "Explain the structure of a hailstone", "answer": "D) Alternating cloudy and clear ice caused by differences in temperature", "mcq": [{"option": "A) Solid ball of cloudy ice caused by rapid freezing high in a thunderstorm", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) Solid ball of clear ice caused by rapid freezing high in a thunderstorm", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) Alternating cloudy and clear ice caused by differences in relative humidity", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) Alternating cloudy and clear ice caused by differences in temperature", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 8 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "How does a positive feedback mechanism differ from a negative feedback mechanism?

Explain.", "answer": "If a perturbation to a system (like climate) causes that perturbation to amplify it is a positive feedback.  As temerpatures rise it could lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere which in turn is a greenhouse gas.  In this respect it is a  positive feedback.  If on the other hand the water vapor produces more thibk clouds this could block out sunlight and be a negative feedback mechanism.  Current thinking is water vapor is more a positive feedback than negative.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 9 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "During the ice crystal process of rain formation:", "answer": "B) ice crystals grow larger at the expense of the surrounding liquid cloud droplets", "mcq": [{"option": "A) only ice crystals need be present in a cloud", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) ice crystals grow larger at the expense of the surrounding liquid cloud droplets", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) the temperature in the cloud must be -40\u00ac\u221eC (-40\u00ac\u221eF) or below", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) the cloud must be a cumuliform cloud", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 10 for Class CLIMATE102_191106", "main": "The region in the United States with the greatest annual frequency of hailstones is:", "answer": "D) the western Great Plains", "mcq": [{"option": "A) Florida", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) the Mississippi Valley", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) the Pacific Northwest", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) the western Great Plains", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}, {"option": "E) Texas", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 5}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
