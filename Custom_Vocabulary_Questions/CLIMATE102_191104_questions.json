(Include in your answer the role that the lowlevel jet plays in the rotating updraft.)"}, "Answer": {"S": "In a region where there is strong vertical wind shear as might be caused with the existence of a low-level jet the thunderstorm may form in such a way that the outflow of cold air from the downdraft never undercuts the updraft. In such a storm the wind shear may be so strong as to create horizontal spin which when tilted into the updraft causes it to rotate. A large long-lasting thunderstorm with a single violently rotating updraft is called a supercell. It is the rotating aspect of the supercell that can lead to the formation of tornadoes."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "1012"}, "Question": {"S": "In an eastward moving thunderstorm the most likely place for a tornado to develop is in the ____ part of the storm."}, "Answer": {"S": "D) southwest"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) northeast"}, {"S": "B) southeast"}, {"S": "C) northwest"}, {"S": "D) southwest"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "690"}, "Question": {"S": "What are thunderstorms?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A storm containing lightning and thunder."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5632c8f9fe0e430b009bab9e"}, "Question": {"S": "The name given to a towering cloud that has not fully developed into a thunderstorm is:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) cumulus congestus"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) cumulus humilis"}, {"S": "B) cumulus congestus"}, {"S": "C) cumulonimbus"}, {"S": "D) altocumulus"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "691"}, "Question": {"S": "What atmospheric conditions are necessary for the development of ordinary cell thunderstorms?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Warm humid air masses away from significant weather fronts."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}]}}}
