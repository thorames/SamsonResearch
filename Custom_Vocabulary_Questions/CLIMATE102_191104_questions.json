(Include in your answer the role that the lowlevel jet plays in the rotating updraft.)", "answer": "In a region where there is strong vertical wind shear as might be caused with the existence of a low-level jet the thunderstorm may form in such a way that the outflow of cold air from the downdraft never undercuts the updraft. In such a storm the wind shear may be so strong as to create horizontal spin which when tilted into the updraft causes it to rotate. A large long-lasting thunderstorm with a single violently rotating updraft is called a supercell. It is the rotating aspect of the supercell that can lead to the formation of tornadoes.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 7 for Class CLIMATE102_191104", "main": "In an eastward moving thunderstorm the most likely place for a tornado to develop is in the ____ part of the storm.", "answer": "D) southwest", "mcq": [{"option": "A) northeast", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) southeast", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) northwest", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) southwest", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 8 for Class CLIMATE102_191104", "main": "What are thunderstorms?", "answer": "A storm containing lightning and thunder.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 9 for Class CLIMATE102_191104", "main": "The name given to a towering cloud that has not fully developed into a thunderstorm is:", "answer": "B) cumulus congestus", "mcq": [{"option": "A) cumulus humilis", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) cumulus congestus", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) cumulonimbus", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) altocumulus", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 10 for Class CLIMATE102_191104", "main": "What atmospheric conditions are necessary for the development of ordinary cell thunderstorms?", "answer": "Warm humid air masses away from significant weather fronts.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
