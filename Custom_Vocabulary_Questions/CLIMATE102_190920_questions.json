The human-induced sources include emissions from factories autos trucks aircraft  power plants home furnaces and fireplaces to name a few. Many aerosols are not injected directly into the atmosphere but form when gases convert to particles. Some particles such as sulfates and nitrates mainly reflect incoming sunlight whereas others such as soot readily absorb sunlight. Many of the particles that reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface tend to cause a net cooling of the surface air during the day. Sulfate aerosols not only reflect incoming sunlight back to space but they also serve as cloud condensation nuclei tiny particles on which cloud droplets form. Consequently they have the potential for altering the physical characteristics of clouds. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that strongly absorbs infrared radiation and plays a major role in the warming of the lower atmosphere.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class CLIMATE102_190920", "main": "Describe how the process of collision and coalescence produces precipitation.", "answer": "Cloud droplets produced initially through the 'solute effect' grow larger by collision with other cloud droplets and sticking (coalescence).
