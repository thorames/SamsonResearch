(b) a region of converging air usually forms on the west side of an upper-level trough and a region of diverging air forms on the east side.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 3 for Class CLIMATE102_191025", "main": "In winter cold-front weather is typically more violent than warm-front weather. Why? Explain why this situation is not necessarily true in summer.", "answer": "The temperature contrast across a wintertime cold front can be much larger than the contrast across a summertime cold front.  The most violent weather occurs when the temperature contrast is larger.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class CLIMATE102_191025", "main": "Why do some mid-latitude cyclones quickly 'die out' after they become occluded?", "answer": "The divergence aloft which removes air over the cyclone follows the place where temeprature contrast at the surface is greatest.

Explain.", "answer": "It will intensify.  When upper-level divergence is stronger than surface convergence surface pressures drop and the low intensifies.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
