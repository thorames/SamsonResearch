(b) a region of converging air usually forms on the west side of an upper-level trough and a region of diverging air forms on the east side."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "666"}, "Question": {"S": "In winter cold-front weather is typically more violent than warm-front weather. Why? Explain why this situation is not necessarily true in summer."}, "Answer": {"S": "The temperature contrast across a wintertime cold front can be much larger than the contrast across a summertime cold front.  The most violent weather occurs when the temperature contrast is larger."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "669"}, "Question": {"S": "Why do some mid-latitude cyclones quickly 'die out' after they become occluded?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The divergence aloft which removes air over the cyclone follows the place where temeprature contrast at the surface is greatest. Afterr the storm occludes the location of greatest temperature contrast shifts away from the center of the cyclone."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "971"}, "Question": {"S": "When upper-level divergence of air above a surface low pressure area is stronger than the convergence of surface air the surface pressure will ____ and the storm itself will ____."}, "Answer": {"S": "C) decrease, intensify"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) increase, intensify"}, {"S": "B) increase, dissipate"}, {"S": "C) decrease, intensify"}, {"S": "D) decrease, dissipate"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562edd8913a2bd0b0069df2c"}, "Question": {"S": "A boundary separating two masses of water with contrasting temperatures is called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) an oceanic front"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) a gyre"}, {"S": "B) an Ekman layer"}, {"S": "C) an oceanic front"}, {"S": "D) an ocean drift"}, {"S": "E) an ocean current"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "985"}, "Question": {"S": "Developing low pressure areas generally have ____ air near the surface and ____ air aloft."}, "Answer": {"S": "A) converging, diverging"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) converging, diverging"}, {"S": "B) diverging, converging"}, {"S": "C) converging, converging"}, {"S": "D) diverging, diverging"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5630ded6dc73a80b008b01db"}, "Question": {"S": "When contrasted to a rural area cities usually do not have higher:"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) visibilities"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) concentrations of pollution"}, {"S": "B) frequency of fog"}, {"S": "C) temperatures"}, {"S": "D) visibilities"}, {"S": "E) frequency of thunderstorms"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563012a413a2bd0b0069e2ba"}, "Question": {"S": "If the flow of air into a surface low pressure area is greater than the divergence of air aloft the surface pressure in the center of the low will:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) increase"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) increase"}, {"S": "B) decrease"}, {"S": "C) remain the same"}, {"S": "D) deepen"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "675"}, "Question": {"S": "If upper-level diverging air above a surface area of low pressure exceeds converging air around the surface low will the surface low-pressure area weaken or intensify?
