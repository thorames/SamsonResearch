The tropical disturbance becomes a tropical depression when the winds increase to between 20 and 34 knots and several closed isobars appear about its center on a surface weather map. When the isobars are packed together and the winds are between 35 and 64 knots the tropical depression becomes a tropical storm. The tropical storm is classified as a hurricane only when its winds exceed 64 knots (74 miles/hour)."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "775"}, "Question": {"S": "How does a hurricane watch differ from a hurricane warning?"}, "Answer": {"S": "When a hurricane poses a direct threat to an area a hurricane watch is issued.
