The circulation of city air constitutes the next largest scale - the mesoscale (meaning middle scale). Typical mesoscale winds range from a few kilometers to about a hundred kilometers in diameter. Generally they last longer than microscale motions often many minutes hours or in some cases as long as a day. Thunderstorms and tornadoes fall under the heading of mesoscale winds. In the largest scale or macroscale circulations dominate regions of hundreds to even thousands of square kilometers typically lasting days and sometimes weeks."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "564155ed2b15ed0b00ec38b6"}, "Question": {"S": "The ____ is an apparent force created by the earth's rotation."}, "Answer": {"S": "B) Coriolis force"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) pressure gradient force"}, {"S": "B) Coriolis force"}, {"S": "C) centripetal force"}, {"S": "D) gravitational force"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "644"}, "Question": {"S": "What does the Coriolis force do to moving air: "}, "Answer": {"S": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)"}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "676"}, "Question": {"S": "How are longwaves in the upper-level westerlies different from shortwaves?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Longwaves are many thousands of kilometers long; shortwaves are small disturbances or ripples."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "934"}, "Question": {"S": "Which of the following forces can not act to change the speed of the wind?"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) Coriolis force"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) pressure gradient force"}, {"S": "B) frictional force"}, {"S": "C) Coriolis force"}, {"S": "D) none of the above"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "456"}, "Question": {"S": "List the most abundant greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere.
