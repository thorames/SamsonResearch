The circulation of city air constitutes the next largest scale - the mesoscale (meaning middle scale). Typical mesoscale winds range from a few kilometers to about a hundred kilometers in diameter. Generally they last longer than microscale motions often many minutes hours or in some cases as long as a day. Thunderstorms and tornadoes fall under the heading of mesoscale winds. In the largest scale or macroscale circulations dominate regions of hundreds to even thousands of square kilometers typically lasting days and sometimes weeks.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class 191028", "main": "Explain how the earth and its atmosphere balance incoming energy with outgoing energy.", "answer": "Incoming solar radiation is absorbed warming the ground. The warm ground emits longwave (infrared) radiation much of which is absorbed in the atmosphere warming the atmosphere. The warm atmosphere radiates both out to space and back to the surface to balance the energy it has absorbed.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 6 for Class 191028", "main": "If the environmental lapse rate is less than the moist adiabatic rate the atmosphere is:", "answer": "B) absolutely stable", "mcq": [{"option": "A) conditionally unstable", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) absolutely stable", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) absolutely unstable", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) neutrally stable", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 7 for Class 191028", "main": "What is a stable atmosphere and how can it form?", "answer": "The atmosphere is stable when the environmental lapse rate is small - that is when the difference in temperature between the surface air and the air aloft is relatively small. Stable atmospheres form when surface air cools or higher-altitude air warms or both.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 8 for Class 191028", "main": "Are you taking this course pass/fail?", "answer": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)", "mcq": [{"option": "A) Yes", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) No", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 9 for Class 191028", "main": "List and explain several processes by which an unstable atmosphere can be made stable.", "answer": "The atmosphere tends to become more stable as the air aloft warms or the surface air cools. If the air aloft is being replaced by warmer air (warm advection) and the surface air is not changing appreciably the environmental lapse rate decreases and the air becomes stable. Similarly if the surface air cools and the aloft air temperature remains relatively constant the air becomes more stable.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 10 for Class 191028", "main": "When the upward-directed pressure gradient force is in balance with the downward pull of gravity the atmosphere is in:", "answer": "A) hydrostatic equilibrium", "mcq": [{"option": "A) hydrostatic equilibrium", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) unstable equilibrium", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) geostrophic balance", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) isobaric balance", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
