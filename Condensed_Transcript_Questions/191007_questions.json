Rising air causes clouds and precipitation while sinking air reduces cloud cover so 30 degrees  ends to be the latitude where many deserts are found.  Air moving poleward from 30 degrees  runs into air flowing from the poles at around 50 degrees  and is forced upward along the polar front maing this a relatively wet region.  The poles tend to be regions of subsidence and tend to be much drier.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 3 for Class 191007", "main": "The winds aloft in the
