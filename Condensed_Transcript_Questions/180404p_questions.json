Why was the old Fujita scale modified?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The original Fujita scale implemented in 1971 was based mainly on tornado damage incurred by a frame house. Because there are many types of structures susceptible to tornado damage a new scale came into effect in February 2007. Called the Enhanced Fujita Scale or simply the EF Scale the new scale attempts to provide a wide range of criteria in estimating a tornado's winds by using a set of 28 damage indicators. These indicators include items such as small barns mobile homes schools and trees. Each item is then examined for the degree of damage it sustained. The combination of the damage indicators along with the degree of damage provides a range of probable wind speeds and an EF rating for the tornado."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "758"}, "Question": {"S": "About two-thirds of all tornadoes fall into which of the following categories on the Fujita scale?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) F0 or F1"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) F0 or F1"}, {"S": "B) F2 or F3"}, {"S": "C) F0 or F5"}, {"S": "D) F4 or F5"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563032e1d72ccd0b00acebcc"}, "Question": {"S": "The small rapidly rotating whirls that sometimes occur within a large tornado are called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) suction vortices"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) microtornadoes"}, {"S": "B) whirl winds"}, {"S": "C) suction vortices"}, {"S": "D) mesocyclones"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "732"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain how a violent multivortex tornado will completely demolish some homes in its path and yet leave others standing."}, "Answer": {"S": "If a tornado is moving northeast at a speed of 50 miles/hour and its rotating winds are 100 miles/hour then the wind speed on the tornado's southeast side would be 150 miles/hour. If a suction vortex is spinning at 50 miles/hour and located in the large tornado's southeastern side then the total wind speed for the tornado on this side would be 50 + 100 + 50 or 200 miles/hour. This situation where stronger winds exist at different regions within a large violent multi-vortex tornado explains why some homes in the tornado's path are completely obliterated while others sustain considerable damage but are left standing."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "764"}, "Question": {"S": "If a hurricane with sustained winds of 100 mi/hr is moving westward at 20 mi/hr will the strongest winds and greatest damage potential be on its northern or southern side? Explain. If the same hurricane turns northward will the strongest winds and greatest damage potential be on its eastern or western side?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Northern side.  With the storm moving westward the north sid gets the combination of hurricane motion plus the speed of the winds blowing onshore on the north side.  On the south side winds will be off shore and slowed by friction and in a direction opposite storm motion."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "756"}, "Question": {"S": "The Fujita scale pertains to:"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) the strength of a tornado"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) the size of a tornado producing thunderstorm"}, {"S": "B) the amount of hail that falls from a mature thunderstorm"}, {"S": "C) the size of the thunderstorm image on a radar screen"}, {"S": "D) the strength of a tornado"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "1011"}, "Question": {"S": "Which below is the best indication that a severe thunderstorm is about to produce a tornado?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) a wall cloud"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) a wall cloud"}, {"S": "B) a roll cloud"}, {"S": "C) a mammatus cloud"}, {"S": "D) a gust front"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "724"}, "Question": {"S": "Is it more likely for a tornado to have a rotating wind speed of 125 mi/hr or 200 mi/hr?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Even the most powerful twisters seldom have winds exceeding 250 miles/hour and most tornadoes have winds of less than 135 miles/hour."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563032aad72ccd0b00acebc6"}, "Question": {"S": "A funnel cloud or tornado may develop from this rotating cloud that extends beneath a severe thunderstorm:"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) wall cloud"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) mammatus cloud"}, {"S": "B) anvil cloud"}, {"S": "C) roll cloud"}, {"S": "D) wall cloud"}, {"S": "E) suction vortice"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5642a6b6f783f00b003db821"}, "Question": {"S": "I am currently"}, "Answer": {"S": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) Freshman"}, {"S": "B) Sophomore"}, {"S": "C) Junior"}, {"S": "D) Senior"}, {"S": "E) Other"}]}}}]}}}
