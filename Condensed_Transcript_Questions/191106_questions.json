About 90 percent of all cloud-to-ground lightning is negative.  However when the base of the cloud is positively charged and the ground negatively charged a positive cloud-to-ground lightning flash may result.  Positive lightning most common with severe thunderstorms has the potential to cause more damage because it generates a much higher current level and its flash lasts for a longer duration than negative lightning.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class 191106", "main": "Explain how a cloud-to-ground lightning stroke develops.", "answer": "<ol> \t<li>When the negative charge near the bottom of the cloud becomes large enough to overcome the air's resistance a flow of electrons - the stepped leader - rushes toward the earth.</li> \t<li>As the electrons approach the ground a region of positive charge moves up into the air through any conducting object such as trees buildings and even humans.</li> \t<li>When the downward flow of electrons meets the upward surge of positive charge a strong electric current - a bright return stroke - carries positive charge upward into the cloud.</li> </ol>", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class 191106", "main": "What would be the proper sequence of events in a lightning flash?", "answer": "D) stepped leader, return stroke, dart leader, return stroke", "mcq": [{"option": "A) stepped leader, dart leader, return stroke, return stroke", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) return stroke, stepped leader, return stroke, dart leader", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) dart leader, return stroke, stepped leader, return stroke", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) stepped leader, return stroke, dart leader, return stroke", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 6 for Class 191106", "main": "The solar wind is:", "answer": "D) charged particles streaming through space from the sun", "mcq": [{"option": "A) the strong wind in outer space", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) another name of electromagnetic radiation", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) another name for a solar flare", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) charged particles streaming through space from the sun", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 7 for Class 191106", "main": "Describe one process by which thunderstorms become electrified.", "answer": "One theory proposes that clouds become electrified when graupel (small ice particles called soft hail) and hailstones fall through a region of supercooled liquid droplets and ice crystals. As liquid droplets collide with a hailstone they freeze on contact and release latent heat. This process keeps the surface of the hailstone warmer than that of the surrounding ice crystals. When the warmer hailstone comes in contact with a colder ice crystal an important phenomenon occurs: There is a net transfer of positive ions (charged molecules) from the warmer object to the colder object. Hence the hailstone (larger warmer particle) becomes negatively charged and the ice crystal (smaller cooler particle) positively charged as the positive ions are incorporated into the ice crystal.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 8 for Class 191106", "main": "Charged particles from the sun that travel through space at high speeds are called:", "answer": "C) solar wind", "mcq": [{"option": "A) radiation", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) the aurora", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) solar wind", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) solar flares", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 9 for Class 191106", "main": "Hypoxia is a condition caused by:", "answer": "A) lack of oxygen going to the brain", "mcq": [{"option": "A) lack of oxygen going to the brain", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) over exposure to ultraviolet radiation", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) the combined effects of heat and humidity", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) rapid changes in atmospheric pressure", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}, {"option": "E) extreme cold", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 5}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 10 for Class 191106", "main": "Why is it unwise to seek shelter under an isolated tree during a thunderstorm? If caught out in the open what should you do?", "answer": "As the electrons approach the ground a region of positive charge moves up into the air through any conducting object such as trees buildings and even humans. Because a positive charge tends to concentrate in upward projecting objects such as trees the upward return stroke that meets the stepped leader is most likely to originate from such objects. Thus it is unsafe to stand near a tree during an electrical storm.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
