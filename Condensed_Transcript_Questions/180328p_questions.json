The flooding is due in part to winds pushing water onto the shore and to the heavy rains. Flooding is also aided by the low pressure of the storm. The region of low pressure allows the ocean level to rise (perhaps half a meter) much like a soft drink rises up a straw as air is withdrawn. The combined effect of high water and high winds produces 'storm surge' - an abnormal rise of several meters in the ocean level."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "549"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain several ways a flash flood might form."}, "Answer": {"S": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)"}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "832"}, "Question": {"S": "If the high winds of a hurricane are not responsible for inflicting the most damage what is?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The huge waves and flooding associated with the storm surge usually cause the most destruction."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563024cf13a2bd0b0069e463"}, "Question": {"S": "Many flash floods including those that occurred in Rapid City South Dakota and in Colorado's Big Thompson Canyon are the result of thunderstorms that:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) move slowly"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) contain no lightning"}, {"S": "B) form in a dry air mass"}, {"S": "C) move slowly"}, {"S": "D) have weak or non-existant downdrafts"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562edfae13a2bd0b0069df5b"}, "Question": {"S": "In Southern California which air mass is mainly responsible for heavy rains flooding in low-lying valleys and melting of snow at high elevations?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) mT"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) mT"}, {"S": "B) mP"}, {"S": "C) cP"}, {"S": "D) cA"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "486"}, "Question": {"S": "When radiation fog 'burns off' what happens to the fog droplets?"}, "Answer": {"S": "They evaporate."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "385"}, "Question": {"S": "Often before sunrise on a clear calm cold morning ice (frost) can be seen on the  tops of parked cars even when the air temperature is above freezing.

The algorithms provide a great deal of information to the forecasters that allows them to make better decisions as to which thunderstorms are most likely to produce severe weather and possible flash flooding. In addition they give advanced and improved warning of an approaching tornado."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "665"}, "Question": {"S": "Why are ice storms more likely to form with a warm front than with a cold front?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Warm air rides up over cold dry surface air causing clouds and precipitation.  When rain falls into the shallow layer of cold air beneath it may evaporate chilling the air even more.  Sometimes the rain freezes before reaching the ground producing sleet.  Other times the rain freezes on impact producing freezing rain.  If the frozen precipitation happens for many hours the result is an ice storm."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}]}}}
