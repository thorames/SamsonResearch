Air would expand on the warm side of the earth (towards the sun) causing a high pressure aloft.  Air would flow aloft toward the cold side and hence add mass to the cold area causing surface pressure there to rise.  The higher pressure at the surface would cause flow back to the warm side.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 2 for Class 191101", "main": "A wind flow pattern that takes on a more or less north-south trajectory is called:", "answer": "D) meridional flow", "mcq": [{"option": "A) gradient flow", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) zonal flow", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) cyclostrophic flow", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) meridional flow", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}, {"option": "E) geostrophic flow", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 5}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 3 for Class 191101", "main": "Major ocean currents that flow parallel to the coast of North America are:", "answer": "B) California, Gulf Stream, Labrador", "mcq": [{"option": "A) Labrador, Canary, California", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) California, Gulf Stream, Labrador", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) Kuroshio, California, Labrador", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) Labrador, Canary, Gulf Stream", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class 191101", "main": "The jet stream flows:", "answer": "D) in a wavy pattern from west to east", "mcq": [{"option": "A) directly from west to east", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) directly from east to west", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) from the equator towards the poles", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) in a wavy pattern from west to east", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class 191101", "main": "If the flow of air into a surface low pressure area is greater than the divergence of air aloft the surface pressure in the center of the low will:", "answer": "A) increase", "mcq": [{"option": "A) increase", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) decrease", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) remain the same", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) deepen", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 6 for Class 191101", "main": "Why are skies oft en clear or partly cloudy in a hurricane's eye?", "answer": "Near the surface of a hurricane moist tropical air flows in toward the hurricane's center. Adjacent to the eye this air rises and condenses into huge cumulonimbus clouds that produce heavy rainfall. Near the top of the clouds the relatively dry air having lost much of its moisture begins to flow outward away from the center. This diverging air aloft actually produces a clockwise (anticyclonic in the Northern Hemisphere) flow of air several hundred kilometers from the eye. As this outflow reaches the storm's periphery it begins to sink and warm inducing clear skies. In the vigorous convective clouds of the eyewall the air warms due to the release of large quantities of latent heat. This warming produces slightly higher pressures aloft which initiate downward air motion within the eye. As the air sinks it warms by compression. This process helps to account for the warm air and the absence of thunderstorms in the center of the storm.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 7 for Class 191101", "main": "When the wind blows in a more or less west to east direction the wind flow pattern is called:", "answer": "D) zonal", "mcq": [{"option": "A) gradient", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) meridional", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) centripetal", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) zonal", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 8 for Class 191101", "main": "Explain why cities in India such as Cherrapunji normally receive over 90 percent of their rainfall between April and October.", "answer": "During the summer monsoon in India the air flowing from the ocean toward the continent becomes much warmer than it was when it was above the water. A shallow low-pressure area develops over the continental interior. The heated air within the low rises and the surrounding air responds by flowing counterclockwise into the low center. This condition results in moisture-bearing winds sweeping into the continent from the ocean. The humid air converges with a drier westerly flow causing it to rise; further lifting is provided by hills and mountains. Lifting cools the air to its saturation point resulting in heavy showers and thunderstorms. Thus the summer monsoon of southeastern Asia which lasts from about June through September means wet rainy weather (wet season) with winds that blow from sea to land.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 9 for Class 191101", "main": "The winds along the Antarctic coast blow from the west and parallel to the coastline.
