A large shallow high-pressure area develops over continental Siberia producing a clockwise circulation of air that flows out over the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Subsiding air of the anticyclone and the downslope movement of northeasterly winds from the inland plateau provide eastern and southern Asia with generally fair weather. Hence the winter monsoon which lasts from about December through February means clear skies (dry season) with winds that blow from land to sea. In summer the wind flow pattern reverses itself as air over the continents becomes much warmer than air above the water. A shallow thermal low develops over the continental interior.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class 191009", "main": "Explain how the ocean conveyor belt plays a role in the climate of northern Europe.", "answer": "Westerly winds blowing across the Atlantic evaporate the warmish waters arriving from the Gulf Stream.  As the water evaporates it leaves behind salt making the water more saline and heavier.  This heavier water slowly sinks and takes with it whatever gases have been absorbed at the surface.  The warmth and moisture resulting from this process keeps Europe warmer than at the same latitudes in North America.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class 191009", "main": "Cyclonic flow means ____ in either the Northern or Southern Hemisphere.", "answer": "C) circulation around a low pressure center", "mcq": [{"option": "A) clockwise wind flow", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) counterclockwise flow", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) circulation around a low pressure center", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) circulation around a high pressure center", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 6 for Class 191009", "main": "The main reason hurricanes don't develop over the south Atlantic Ocean adjacent to South America is because:", "answer": "C) the surface water temperatures are too cold", "mcq": [{"option": "A) the Coriolis force is too small there", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) the pressure gradient force is too weak in that area", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) the surface water temperatures are too cold", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) the air at the surface is always diverging", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 7 for Class 191009", "main": "The most important reason why summers in the Southern Hemisphere are not warmer than  summers in the Northern Hemisphere is that:", "answer": "C) over 80% of the Southern Hemisphere is covered with water", "mcq": [{"option": "A) the earth is closer to the sun in January", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) the earth is farther from the sun in July", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) over 80% of the Southern Hemisphere is covered with water", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) the sun's energy is less intense in the Southern Hemisphere", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 8 for Class 191009", "main": "Describe how the wind blows around areas of surface low- and high-pressure in the Northern Hemisphere.", "answer": "In the Northern Hemisphere surface winds blow counterclockwise and in toward an area of low pressure; they blow clockwise and outward around an area of high pressure.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 9 for Class 191009", "main": "Surface wnds along the west coast of South America are driven by the Pacific high and will generally flow", "answer": "C) From the south", "mcq": [{"option": "A) From the north", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) From the east", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) From the south", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) From the west", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 10 for Class 191009", "main": "Explain why average summer (January) temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere are cooler than average summer (July) temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere even though the earth is closer to the sun in January.", "answer": "Nearly 81 percent of the Southern Hemisphere surface is water compared to 61 percent in the Northern Hemisphere. The added solar energy due to the closeness of the sun is absorbed by large bodies of water becoming well mixed and circulated within them. This process keeps the average summer (January) temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere cooler than the average summer (July) temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. The water's large heat capacity also tends to keep winters in the Southern Hemisphere warmer than we might expect.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
