If caught out in the open what should you do?"}, "Answer": {"S": "As the electrons approach the ground a region of positive charge moves up into the air through any conducting object such as trees buildings and even humans. Because a positive charge tends to concentrate in upward projecting objects such as trees the upward return stroke that meets the stepped leader is most likely to originate from such objects. Thus it is unsafe to stand near a tree during an electrical storm."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563132acdc73a80b008b04ee"}, "Question": {"S": "Which of the following cities would most likely have a dry summer?"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) Los Angeles, California"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) Chicago, Illinois"}, {"S": "B) Denver, Colorado"}, {"S": "C) Los Angeles, California"}, {"S": "D) Baltimore, Maryland"}, {"S": "E) Seattle, Washington"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56302c8813a2bd0b0069e50f"}, "Question": {"S": "A discharge of electricity from or within a thunderstorm is called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) lightning"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) static electricity"}, {"S": "B) lightning"}, {"S": "C) a downburst"}, {"S": "D) St. Elmo's fire"}, {"S": "E) an atmospheric arc"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "1003"}, "Question": {"S": "What would be the proper sequence of events in a lightning flash?"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) stepped leader, return stroke, dart leader, return stroke"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) stepped leader, dart leader, return stroke, return stroke"}, {"S": "B) return stroke, stepped leader, return stroke, dart leader"}, {"S": "C) dart leader, return stroke, stepped leader, return stroke"}, {"S": "D) stepped leader, return stroke, dart leader, return stroke"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "713"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain how a cloud-to-ground lightning stroke develops."}, "Answer": {"S": "<ol> \t<li>When the negative charge near the bottom of the cloud becomes large enough to overcome the air's resistance a flow of electrons - the stepped leader - rushes toward the earth.</li> \t<li>As the electrons approach the ground a region of positive charge moves up into the air through any conducting object such as trees buildings and even humans.</li> \t<li>When the downward flow of electrons meets the upward surge of positive charge a strong electric current - a bright return stroke - carries positive charge upward into the cloud.</li> </ol>"}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "1005"}, "Question": {"S": "In cloud-to-ground lightning the stepped leader travels ____ and the return stroke travels ____."}, "Answer": {"S": "C) downward, upward"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) upward, upward"}, {"S": "B) upward, downward"}, {"S": "C) downward, upward"}, {"S": "D) downward, downward"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56303494d72ccd0b00acebf7"}, "Question": {"S": "The region in the United States with the greatest annual frequency of hailstones is:"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) the western Great Plains"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) Florida"}, {"S": "B) the Mississippi Valley"}, {"S": "C) the Pacific Northwest"}, {"S": "D) the western Great Plains"}, {"S": "E) Texas"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5630dd1cdc73a80b008b01ad"}, "Question": {"S": "Overall the air in Los Angeles is ____ it was 10 years ago."}, "Answer": {"S": "A) less polluted today than"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) less polluted today than"}, {"S": "B) more humid today than"}, {"S": "C) about as polluted today as"}, {"S": "D) significantly denser today than"}, {"S": "E) more polluted today than"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562ee62313a2bd0b0069dfee"}, "Question": {"S": "The upper air flow on the following map would bring ____ air masses into western Canada and the United States and ____ air masses into the eastern United States."}, "Answer": {"S": "D) cA, mT"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) mP, mT"}, {"S": "B) cA, mP"}, {"S": "C) mP, cP"}, {"S": "D) cA, mT"}, {"S": "E) cT, mT"}]}}}]}}}
