The warm ground emits longwave (infrared) radiation much of which is absorbed in the atmosphere warming the atmosphere. The warm atmosphere radiates both out to space and back to the surface to balance the energy it has absorbed."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562fcdba13a2bd0b0069e0f5"}, "Question": {"S": "At a warm front the warm air:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) rises and cools"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) rises and cools"}, {"S": "B) rises and warms"}, {"S": "C) sinks and cools"}, {"S": "D) sinks and warms"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "448"}, "Question": {"S": "What are the most abundant selectively absorbing greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The most abundant is water vapor though it is variable.
