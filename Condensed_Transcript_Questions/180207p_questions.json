What climate patterns (cool/ warm wet/dry) tend to exist during the warm phase and the cool phase?"}, "Answer": {"S": "During the warm (or positive) phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation unusually warm surface water exists along the west coast of North America whereas over the central North Pacific cooler than normal surface water prevails. At the same time the Aleutian low in the Gulf of Alaska strengthens which causes more Pacific storms to move into Alaska and California. This situation causes winters as a whole to be warmer and drier over northwestern North America. Elsewhere winters tend to be drier over the Great Lakes and cooler and wetter in the southern United States."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "927"}, "Question": {"S": "The winds along the Antarctic coast blow from the west and parallel to the coastline.

La Nina?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Under ordinary conditions higher pressure over the southeastern Pacific and lower pressure near Indonesia produces easterly trade winds along the equator. These winds promote upwelling and cooler ocean water in the eastern Pacific while warmer water prevails in the western Pacific. The trades are part of a circulation (called the Walker circulation) that typically finds rising air and heavy rain over the western Pacific and sinking air and generally dry weather over the eastern Pacific. When the trades are exceptionally strong water along the equator in the eastern Pacific becomes quite cool. This cool event is called La Nina. During El Nino conditions atmospheric pressure decreases over the eastern Pacific and rises over the western Pacific. This change in pressure causes the trades to weaken or reverse direction. This situation enhances the countercurrent that carries warm water from the west over a vast region of the eastern tropical Pacific. The thermocline which separates the warm water of the upper ocean from the cold water below changes as the ocean conditions change from non-El Nino to El Nino."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56414dbe2b15ed0b00ec37e9"}, "Question": {"S": "A northeaster along the east coast of the United States is best developed when a low pressure area:"}, "Answer": {"S": "E) moves northeastward over the Atlantic Ocean adjacent to the coast"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) moves from west to east over Canada"}, {"S": "B) moves eastward over the Great Lakes"}, {"S": "C) moves northward over Ohio"}, {"S": "D) moves northeastward from the Texas panhandle"}, {"S": "E) moves northeastward over the Atlantic Ocean adjacent to the coast"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "587"}, "Question": {"S": "What is a monsoon wind system and how does it form over India?"}, "Answer": {"S": "During the winter the air over the continent becomes much colder than the air over the ocean. A large shallow high-pressure area develops over continental Siberia producing a clockwise circulation of air that flows out over the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Subsiding air of the anticyclone and the downslope movement of northeasterly winds from the inland plateau provide eastern and southern Asia with generally fair weather. Hence the winter monsoon which lasts from about December through February means clear skies (dry season) with winds that blow from land to sea. In summer the wind flow pattern reverses itself as air over the continents becomes much warmer than air above the water. A shallow thermal low develops over the continental interior."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e8c5b02cba50b007693c8"}, "Question": {"S": "In the Northern Hemisphere ocean currents in the Atlantic and the Pacific move in a generally circular pattern.
