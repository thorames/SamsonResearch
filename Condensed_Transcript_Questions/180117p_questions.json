The orbit moves from roughly circular to elliptical.  An elliptical orbit harvests less sunlight over the year.  2. The tilt of the eart wobbles pointing now toward the North Star it will point elsewhere over time changing the time of year that the earth is closest the sun.  3. The tilt of the earth varies from 21.5 degrees  to 24.5 degrees  thus changing the degree of seasonality."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562d3b6d9b0e970b005e768c"}, "Question": {"S": "Relative humidity changes with:"}, "Answer": {"S": "E) all of the above"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) addition of water vapor to the air"}, {"S": "B) decreases in temperature"}, {"S": "C) increases in temperature"}, {"S": "D) removal of water vapor from the air"}, {"S": "E) all of the above"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "885"}, "Question": {"S": "It appears that as the number of sunspots increases the sun's total energy output:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) increases slightly"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) increases slightly"}, {"S": "B) decreases slightly"}, {"S": "C) begins to alternately increase and decrease above average values"}, {"S": "D) does not change"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562c499541da0f0b00c11a1a"}, "Question": {"S": "Sunspots:"}, "Answer": {"S": "E) all of the above"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) appear darker than the rest of the sun's surface"}, {"S": "B) are cooler regions on the sun's surface"}, {"S": "C) are located in regions of strong magnetic fields"}, {"S": "D) reach a maximum on the sun approximately every 11 years"}, {"S": "E) all of the above"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56312d98dc73a80b008b047e"}, "Question": {"S": "Plate tectonics explains certain climatic changes by showing that these changes may be related to:"}, "Answer": {"S": "E) all of the above"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) mountain building"}, {"S": "B) the amount of CO2 and H2O released into the atmosphere"}, {"S": "C) the paths taken by ocean currents"}, {"S": "D) the position of the continents"}, {"S": "E) all of the above"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562da01702cba50b00769100"}, "Question": {"S": "On a 500 millibar chart ____ are drawn to represent horizontal changes in altitude  which correspond to horizontal changes in pressure."}, "Answer": {"S": "A) contour lines"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) contour lines"}, {"S": "B) isobars"}, {"S": "C) isotherms"}, {"S": "D) isotachs"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "808"}, "Question": {"S": "List some of the natural causes of climate change."}, "Answer": {"S": "1.
