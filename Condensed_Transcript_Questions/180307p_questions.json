Air would expand on the warm side of the earth (towards the sun) causing a high pressure aloft.  Air would flow aloft toward the cold side and hence add mass to the cold area causing surface pressure there to rise.  The higher pressure at the surface would cause flow back to the warm side."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "667"}, "Question": {"S": "Why are mid-latitude cyclonic storms called 'extratropical cyclones'?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A middle-latitude cyclonic storm is a storm that forms at middle and high latitudes outside of the tropics."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}]}}}
