This radiation travels away from these gases in all directions. A portion of this energy is radiated toward the earth's surface and absorbed thus heating the ground. The earth in turn radiates infrared energy upward where it is absorbed by these gases warming the lower atmosphere. In this way the selectively-absorbing greenhouse gases absorb and radiate infrared energy and act as an insulating layer around the earth keeping part of the earth's infrared radiation from escaping rapidly into space. Consequently the earth's surface and the lower atmosphere are much warmer than they would be if these selectively absorbing gases were not present.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class 190909", "main": "Explain how the earth and its atmosphere balance incoming energy with outgoing energy.", "answer": "Incoming solar radiation is absorbed warming the ground. The warm ground emits longwave (infrared) radiation much of which is absorbed in the atmosphere warming the atmosphere. The warm atmosphere radiates both out to space and back to the surface to balance the energy it has absorbed.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 5 for Class 190909", "main": "The atmosphere near the earth's surface is heated from below.
