Surface winds increase in speed as they blow counterclockwise and inward toward this center. (In the Southern Hemisphere the winds blow clockwise around the center.) Adjacent to the eye is the eyewall a ring of intense thunderstorms that whirl around the storm's center and may extend upward to almost 18 km (59000 ft) above sea level. Within the eyewall we find the heaviest precipitation and the strongest winds."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563039f3d72ccd0b00acec7e"}, "Question": {"S": "The main difference between a hurricane and a tropical storm is that:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) winds speeds are greater in a hurricane"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) hurricanes are larger"}, {"S": "B) tropical storms are more than 500 miles from the US mainland"}, {"S": "C) winds speeds are greater in a hurricane"}, {"S": "D) hurricanes have a clearly defined eye on satellite photographs"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56303625d72ccd0b00acec1e"}, "Question": {"S": "Suppose that 5 of this year's tropical storms develop into hurricanes over the north Atlantic Ocean.

The tropical disturbance becomes a tropical depression when the winds increase to between 20 and 34 knots and several closed isobars appear about its center on a surface weather map. When the isobars are packed together and the winds are between 35 and 64 knots the tropical depression becomes a tropical storm. The tropical storm is classified as a hurricane only when its winds exceed 64 knots (74 miles/hour)."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563028cb13a2bd0b0069e4c2"}, "Question": {"S": "In the center of a hurricane known as the ____ the surface air pressure is much ____ than the air pressure near the outside of the storm."}, "Answer": {"S": "B) eye, lower"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) eye wall, lower"}, {"S": "B) eye, lower"}, {"S": "C) eye wall, higher"}, {"S": "D) eye, higher"}]}}}]}}}
