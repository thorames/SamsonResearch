Rising air causes clouds and precipitation while sinking air reduces cloud cover so 30 degrees  ends to be the latitude where many deserts are found.  Air moving poleward from 30 degrees  runs into air flowing from the poles at around 50 degrees  and is forced upward along the polar front maing this a relatively wet region.  The poles tend to be regions of subsidence and tend to be much drier."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5633d3edea43650b00f77616"}, "Question": {"S": "Subsidence inversions are best developed with ____ pressure areas because of the ____ air motions associated with them."}, "Answer": {"S": "B) high, sinking"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) high, rising"}, {"S": "B) high, sinking"}, {"S": "C) low, rising"}, {"S": "D) low, sinking"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "881"}, "Question": {"S": "Sinking air warms by this process:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) compression"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) compression"}, {"S": "B) expansion"}, {"S": "C) condensation"}, {"S": "D) friction"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "434"}, "Question": {"S": "Why are clouds more common with areas of low pressure?"}, "Answer": {"S": "As the surface air spins inward toward the area of low pressure it flows together and rises much like toothpaste does when its open tube is squeezed. The rising air cools and water vapor in the air condenses into clouds. Hence above areas of surface low pressure we often find clouds and precipitation. As the surface air flows outward away from the area of surface high pressure sinking air from above gradually replaces the laterally spreading surface air. Since sinking air does not usually produce clouds we find generally clear skies and fair weather associated with regions of high atmospheric pressure."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e8f9802cba50b00769414"}, "Question": {"S": "On a weather map of the Northern Hemisphere one would observe the westerlies:"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) between the subpolar lows and the subtropical highs"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) north of the subpolar lows"}, {"S": "B) south of the tropical highs"}, {"S": "C) between the doldrums and the horse latitudes"}, {"S": "D) between the subpolar lows and the subtropical highs"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "573"}, "Question": {"S": "If the earth did not rotate how would surface winds tend to blow?"}, "Answer": {"S": "If the earth did not rotate there would be no Coriolis force.  Air would expand on the warm side of the earth (towards the sun) causing a high pressure aloft.  Air would flow aloft toward the cold side and hence add mass to the cold area causing surface pressure there to rise.  The higher pressure at the surface would cause flow back to the warm side."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}]}}}
