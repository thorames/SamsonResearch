Why does steady precipitation normally fall from stratiform clouds?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Cumulonimbus clouds normally contain large convection currents causing heavy showers. Continuous rain usually falls from a layered cloud that covers a large area and has smaller vertical air currents."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5633d812ea43650b00f77651"}, "Question": {"S": "The rate at which the temperature changes inside a rising (or descending) parcel of saturated air is called the:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) moist adiabatic lapse rate"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) environmental lapse rate"}, {"S": "B) dry adiabatic lapse rate"}, {"S": "C) moist adiabatic lapse rate"}, {"S": "D) latent heat release rate"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "665"}, "Question": {"S": "Why are ice storms more likely to form with a warm front than with a cold front?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Warm air rides up over cold dry surface air causing clouds and precipitation.  When rain falls into the shallow layer of cold air beneath it may evaporate chilling the air even more.  Sometimes the rain freezes before reaching the ground producing sleet.  Other times the rain freezes on impact producing freezing rain.  If the frozen precipitation happens for many hours the result is an ice storm."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56352528e2d1a60b006856b3"}, "Question": {"S": "Rain which falls from a cloud but evaporates before reaching the ground is referred to as:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) virga"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) sleet"}, {"S": "B) virga"}, {"S": "C) graupel"}, {"S": "D) dry rain"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "523"}, "Question": {"S": "Describe the necessary conditions for the formation of convective instability. How do you feel convective instability may play a role in the formation of intense thunderstorms?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Convective instability is brought about by the lifting of a stable layer whose surface is humid and whose top is dry.  Convective instability is associated with the development of severe storms because these types of moisture conditions are often found in thunderstorm environments."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5632d212fe0e430b009bac78"}, "Question": {"S": "Fog that most often forms as warm rain falls into a cold layer of surface air is called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) evaporation (mixing) fog"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) radiation fog"}, {"S": "B) evaporation (mixing) fog"}, {"S": "C) advection fog"}, {"S": "D) upslope fog"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563523fce2d1a60b00685697"}, "Question": {"S": "Fall streaks most often form with:"}, "Answer": {"S": "E) cirrus clouds"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) nimbostratus clouds"}, {"S": "B) cumulonimbus clouds"}, {"S": "C) stratus clouds"}, {"S": "D) altostratus clouds"}, {"S": "E) cirrus clouds"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "500"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain how mammatus clouds form."}, "Answer": {"S": "Downdrafts near a cumulonimbus (usually on the anvil) carry portion of cloud toward the ground."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "564113c72b15ed0b00ec3756"}, "Question": {"S": "If rain falls on one side of a street and not on the other side the rain most likely fell from a:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) cumulonimbus cloud"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) nimbostratus cloud"}, {"S": "B) stratus cloud"}, {"S": "C) cumulonimbus cloud"}, {"S": "D) altostratus cloud"}, {"S": "E) altocumulus cloud"}]}}}]}}}
