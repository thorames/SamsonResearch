How and where do they form? How do they produce hazardous weather for shipping?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Polar lows are cyclones that form poleward of the polar front. They form when frigid air from ice-covered land or water surfaces comes in contact with warmer air that was located over ice-free waters. Like hurricanes these smaller intense storms normally have a warmer central core strong winds (often gale force or higher) and heavy showery precipitation that unlike a hurricane is in the form of snow."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "832"}, "Question": {"S": "If the high winds of a hurricane are not responsible for inflicting the most damage what is?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The huge waves and flooding associated with the storm surge usually cause the most destruction."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "777"}, "Question": {"S": "Give two reasons why hurricanes are more likely to strike New Jersey than Oregon."}, "Answer": {"S": "Sea surface temperatures offshore of New Jersey are warmer than those offshore of Oregon. Also a typical path of Atlantic hurricanes passes westward across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean Sea then turns northward along the eastern shore of North America passing close to New Jersey. Typical paths of Pacific hurricanes pass nowhere near Oregon."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "772"}, "Question": {"S": "As Hurricane Katrina moved toward the Louisiana coast it underwent eyewall replacement. What actually happened to the eyewall during this process?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Katrina's rainbands near the center of the storm converged cutting off moisture to the eyewall and causing it to dissipate. A new one formed farther away."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "769"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain how a storm surge forms. How does it inflict damage in hurricane-prone areas?"}, "Answer": {"S": "The combined effect of high water (which is usually well above the high-tide level) high winds and the net Ekman transport toward the coast produces the storm surge - an abnormal rise of several meters in the ocean level - which inundates low-lying areas and turns beachfront homes into piles of splinters. The storm surge is particularly damaging when it coincides with normal high tides."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "549"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain several ways a flash flood might form."}, "Answer": {"S": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)"}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "376"}, "Question": {"S": "A heat transfer process in the atmosphere that depends upon the vertical movement of air is:"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) convection"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) conduction"}, {"S": "B) absorption"}, {"S": "C) reflection"}, {"S": "D) convection"}, {"S": "E) radiation"}]}}}]}}}
