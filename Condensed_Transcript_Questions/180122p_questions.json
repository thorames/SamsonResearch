Is the water vapor-greenhouse feedback considered positive or negative? Explain."}, "Answer": {"S": "If a perturbation to a system (like climate) causes that perturbation to amplify it is a positive feedback.  As temerpatures rise it could lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere which in turn is a greenhouse gas.  In this respect it is a  positive feedback.  If on the other hand the water vapor produces more thibk clouds this could block out sunlight and be a negative feedback mechanism.  Current thinking is water vapor is more a positive feedback than negative."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562c41f741da0f0b00c11965"}, "Question": {"S": "On the average as a cloud grows thicker (taller) which below does not occur?"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) less sunlight is absorbed by the cloud"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) more sunlight is reflected from the cloud"}, {"S": "B) less sunlight is transmitted through the cloud"}, {"S": "C) less sunlight is absorbed by the cloud"}, {"S": "D) more light is scattered by the cloud"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562fcdba13a2bd0b0069e0f5"}, "Question": {"S": "At a warm front the warm air:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) rises and cools"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) rises and cools"}, {"S": "B) rises and warms"}, {"S": "C) sinks and cools"}, {"S": "D) sinks and warms"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562ce8f241da0f0b00c11a61"}, "Question": {"S": "In July at middle latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere the day is ____ long and is  ____ with each passing day."}, "Answer": {"S": "D) more than 12 hours, getting shorter"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) less than 12 hours, getting longer"}, {"S": "B) less than 12 hours, getting shorter"}, {"S": "C) more than 12 hours, getting longer"}, {"S": "D) more than 12 hours, getting shorter"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5635272ee2d1a60b006856e6"}, "Question": {"S": "Particles in the atmosphere on which ice crystals grow are called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) ice nuclei"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) virga"}, {"S": "B) ice nuclei"}, {"S": "C) condensation nuclei"}, {"S": "D) graupel"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5642a9d9f783f00b003db85b"}, "Question": {"S": "On a scale of 1 to 5 to what degree do you feel pressure from family and/or friends to get a high grade in this course"}, "Answer": {"S": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) 1 = Very Low"}, {"S": "B) 2"}, {"S": "C) 3"}, {"S": "D) 4"}, {"S": "E) 5 = Very High"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "454"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain how the earth and its atmosphere balance incoming energy with outgoing energy."}, "Answer": {"S": "Incoming solar radiation is absorbed warming the ground. The warm ground emits longwave (infrared) radiation much of which is absorbed in the atmosphere warming the atmosphere.

Violent upsurging air currents within the cloud carry small embryos high above the freezing level. As the embryos pass through regions of varying liquid water content a coating of ice forms around them and they grow larger and larger. When the ice particles are appreciable size they become too large and heavy to be supported by the rising air and they then begin to fall as hail. As they slowly descend the hailstones may get caught in a violent updraft only to be carried upward once again to repeat the cycle."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "826"}, "Question": {"S": "List some of the consequences that global warming might have on the atmosphere and its inhabitants."}, "Answer": {"S": "Climate models predict that land areas will warm more rapidly than the global average particularly in the northern high latitudes in winter. If warming allows the boreal forests to expand into the tundra the forests may accelerate the warming in that region. As the temperature rises organic matter in the soil should decompose at a faster rate adding more CO2 to the air which might accelerate the warming even more. In a warmer world enhanced evaporation of water should lead to greater worldwide average precipitation. Some models predict that the jet stream will weaken and global winds will shift from their 'normal' position. The shifting upper-level winds might reduce precipitation over certain areas which in turn would put added stress on certain agricultural regions."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "894"}, "Question": {"S": "Which of the following is a positive feedback on climate"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) Increasing warming melts polar sea ice which causes surface to have lower albedo"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) Increasing warming increases moisture in atmosphere which increases cloudiness"}, {"S": "B) Increasing warming increases drought which causes surface to have higher albedo"}, {"S": "C) Increasing warming melts polar sea ice which causes surface to have lower albedo"}, {"S": "D) Increasing warming leads to greater biological growth which increases photosynthesis"}]}}}]}}}
