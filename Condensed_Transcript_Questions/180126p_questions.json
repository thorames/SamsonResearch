La Nina?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Under ordinary conditions higher pressure over the southeastern Pacific and lower pressure near Indonesia produces easterly trade winds along the equator. These winds promote upwelling and cooler ocean water in the eastern Pacific while warmer water prevails in the western Pacific. The trades are part of a circulation (called the Walker circulation) that typically finds rising air and heavy rain over the western Pacific and sinking air and generally dry weather over the eastern Pacific. When the trades are exceptionally strong water along the equator in the eastern Pacific becomes quite cool. This cool event is called La Nina. During El Nino conditions atmospheric pressure decreases over the eastern Pacific and rises over the western Pacific. This change in pressure causes the trades to weaken or reverse direction. This situation enhances the countercurrent that carries warm water from the west over a vast region of the eastern tropical Pacific. The thermocline which separates the warm water of the upper ocean from the cold water below changes as the ocean conditions change from non-El Nino to El Nino."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e8d2902cba50b007693da"}, "Question": {"S": "The position of the Pacific high over the north Pacific Ocean shifts ____ in winter and ____ in summer."}, "Answer": {"S": "B) southward, northward"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) northward, southward"}, {"S": "B) southward, northward"}, {"S": "C) eastward, westward"}, {"S": "D) westward, eastward"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "812"}, "Question": {"S": "Given the analysis of air bubbles trapped in polar ice during the past 400000 years were CO2 levels generally higher or lower during colder glacial periods?"}, "Answer": {"S": "During glacial periods CO2 levels were generally lower.  During glacial periods ocean water lowered as water evaporated and was deposited on land as snow.  The exposed land led to increased loads of nutrients into the ocean which caused biological growth and the systematic removal of CO2 leading to a positive feedback and further lowering of temperatures."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "751"}, "Question": {"S": "What is the name given to a hurricane-like storm that forms over the western North Pacific Ocean?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Typhoon."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5630369cd72ccd0b00acec2a"}, "Question": {"S": "An intense storm of tropical origin that forms over the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the west coast of Mexico would be called a:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) hurricane"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) hurricane"}, {"S": "B) typhoon"}, {"S": "C) cyclone"}, {"S": "D) willy willy"}, {"S": "E) baguio"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5631163adc73a80b008b0374"}, "Question": {"S": "The CLIMAP project was able to reconstruct the earth's ocean surface temperature in the past by examining:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) thousands of feet of sediment at the bottom of the ocean"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) deep ocean water"}, {"S": "B) rock layers on land"}, {"S": "C) thousands of feet of sediment at the bottom of the ocean"}, {"S": "D) soils deposited over the North American continent"}]}}}]}}}
