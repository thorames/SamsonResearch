If the air aloft is being replaced by warmer air (warm advection) and the surface air is not changing appreciably the environmental lapse rate decreases and the air becomes stable. Similarly if the surface air cools and the aloft air temperature remains relatively constant the air becomes more stable."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5642a9d9f783f00b003db85b"}, "Question": {"S": "On a scale of 1 to 5 to what degree do you feel pressure from family and/or friends to get a high grade in this course"}, "Answer": {"S": "(NO ANSWER PROVIDED)"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) 1 = Very Low"}, {"S": "B) 2"}, {"S": "C) 3"}, {"S": "D) 4"}, {"S": "E) 5 = Very High"}]}}}]}}}
