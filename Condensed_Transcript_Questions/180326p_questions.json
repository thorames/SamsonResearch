The wind speed increases rapidly with height producing strong wind speed shear. This type of shearing causes the cell inside the storm to tilt in such a way that the updraft actually rides up and over the downdraft."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e884b02cba50b00769363"}, "Question": {"S": "An abrupt change in wind speed or wind direction is called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) wind shear"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) wind shear"}, {"S": "B) an air pocket"}, {"S": "C) flurry"}, {"S": "D) squall"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "425"}, "Question": {"S": "How does the average speed of air molecules relate to the air temperature?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Higher temperatures correspond to faster average speeds and lower temperatures to slower average speeds."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "741"}, "Question": {"S": "Supercell thunderstorms that produce tornadoes form in a region of strong wind shear. Explain how the wind usually changes in speed and direction to produce this shear."}, "Answer": {"S": "Rapidly increasing wind speed with height provides vertical wind speed shear and the changing wind direction with height - from southerly at low levels to westerly at high levels - provides wind direction shear which induces the updrafts inside the storms to rotate."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5632d81ffe0e430b009bad18"}, "Question": {"S": "Which of the instruments below indicates both wind speed and wind direction?"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) aerovane"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) wind vane"}, {"S": "B) aerovane"}, {"S": "C) cup anemometer"}, {"S": "D) psychrometer"}, {"S": "E) theodolite"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5632d7eefe0e430b009bad12"}, "Question": {"S": "Which instrument only measures wind speed?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) anemometer"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) anemometer"}, {"S": "B) wind sock"}, {"S": "C) wind vane"}, {"S": "D) rawinsonde observation"}, {"S": "E) aerovane"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5632d94efe0e430b009bad3a"}, "Question": {"S": "An instrument used to measure wind speed is called a(an):"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) anemometer"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) anemometer"}, {"S": "B) ceilometer"}, {"S": "C) psychrometer"}, {"S": "D) tachometer"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562e8cf902cba50b007693d3"}, "Question": {"S": "Lines of equal wind speed are called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) isotachs"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) isobars"}, {"S": "B) isoknots"}, {"S": "C) isotachs"}, {"S": "D) isospeeds"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562ce7d941da0f0b00c11a4d"}, "Question": {"S": "Charged particles from the sun that travel through space at high speeds are called:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) solar wind"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) radiation"}, {"S": "B) the aurora"}, {"S": "C) solar wind"}, {"S": "D) solar flares"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563034eed72ccd0b00acebfe"}, "Question": {"S": "During the summer what conditions prevail near the surface over the Great Plains that help a hailstone survive as ice all the way to the ground?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) a warm, shallow layer of dry air"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) a warm, shallow layer of dry air"}, {"S": "B) a warm, thick layer of moist air"}, {"S": "C) a cold, shallow layer of dry air"}, {"S": "D) a cold, thick layer of moist air"}, {"S": "E) a warm, shallow layer of moist air"}]}}}]}}}
