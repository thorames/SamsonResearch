Divergence tends to be strongest in the southwest flow ahead of an upper-air trough."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "686"}, "Question": {"S": "Describe the weather conditions necessary for a blizzard to form over the northern Great Plains."}, "Answer": {"S": "A blizzard implies strong winds hence the storm requires a strong pressure gradient.  A strong pressure gradient will occur when the central pressure of the storm is exceptionally low which can occur is exceptionally strong divergence occurs over the cyclone.  To get a strong divergence requires a strong jet stream which in turn requires an intense temperature gradient at the surface."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "543"}, "Question": {"S": "Describe how hail might form in a cumulonimbus cloud."}, "Answer": {"S": "Hail is produced in a cumulonimbus cloud when graupel large frozen raindrops or just about any particles (even insects) act as embryos that grow by accumulating supercooled liquid droplets. Violent upsurging air currents within the cloud carry small embryos high above the freezing level. As the embryos pass through regions of varying liquid water content a coating of ice forms around them and they grow larger and larger. When the ice particles are appreciable size they become too large and heavy to be supported by the rising air and they then begin to fall as hail. As they slowly descend the hailstones may get caught in a violent updraft only to be carried upward once again to repeat the cycle."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "522"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain why rain shadows form on the leeward side of mountains."}, "Answer": {"S": "Because the clouds and precipitation generally form on the upwind side of the range and by the time the air gets to the leeward side there's not much moisture left."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "1011"}, "Question": {"S": "Which below is the best indication that a severe thunderstorm is about to produce a tornado?"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) a wall cloud"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) a wall cloud"}, {"S": "B) a roll cloud"}, {"S": "C) a mammatus cloud"}, {"S": "D) a gust front"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5630320513a2bd0b0069e59b"}, "Question": {"S": "Most tornadoes move from:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) southwest to northeast"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) northwest to southwest"}, {"S": "B) southwest to northeast"}, {"S": "C) south to north"}, {"S": "D) southeast to northwest"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562ee73213a2bd0b0069e005"}, "Question": {"S": "A good source region for an air mass would be:"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) generally flat areas of uniform composition with light surface winds"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) mountains with deep valleys and strong surface winds"}, {"S": "B) generally flat areas of uniform composition with light surface winds"}, {"S": "C) hilly with deep valleys and light winds"}, {"S": "D) generally flat area of uniform composition with strong surface winds"}]}}}]}}}
