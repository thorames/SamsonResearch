Winds then transport this invisible moist air to other regions where the water vapor condenses back into liquid forming cloud. Under certain conditions the liquid (or solid) cloud particles may grow in size and fall to the surface as precipitation - rain snow or hail. If the precipitation falls into an ocean the water is ready to begin its cycle again. If on the other hand the precipitation falls on a continent a great deal of the water returns to the ocean in a complex journey. This cycle of moving and transforming water molecules from liquid to vapor and back to liquid again is called the hydrologic (water) cycle. In the form with which we are most concerned water molecules travel from ocean to atmosphere to land and then back to the ocean.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 3 for Class 190916", "main": "Michigan Stadium contains multiple materials from the grass(?) on the field to the concrete and metal of the seats. On top of that it has multiple slopes which will increase or decrease the sunlight exposure around the stadium. We will be visiting Michigan Stadium on a hopefully sunny day to be determined to make measurements of the temperatures around the bowl of the stadium. What spot in the stadium would you expect to have the warmest surface?", "answer": "Virtually any answer is OK as long as it's in the stadium amd likely in the sunshine.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 4 for Class 190916", "main": "If the air temperature is close to the dew point would the relative humidity be high or low?
