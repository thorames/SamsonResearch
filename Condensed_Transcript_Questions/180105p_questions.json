Its pieces slowly moved across the face of the earth thus changing the distribution of continents and ocean basins. We find glacial features near sea level in Africa today suggesting that the area underwent a period of glaciation hundreds of millions of years ago. Were temperatures at low elevations near the equator ever cold enough to produce ice sheets? Probably not. The ice sheets formed when this land mass was located at a much higher latitude. Over the many millions of years since then the land has slowly moved to its present position. Along the same line we can see how the fossil remains of tropical vegetation can be found under layers of ice in polar regions today."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "820"}, "Question": {"S": "Climate models predict that increasing levels of CO2 will cause the mean global surface air temperature to rise significantly by the year 2100.
