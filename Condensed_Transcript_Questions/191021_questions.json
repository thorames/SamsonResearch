As a parcel of warm humid air rises it cools and condenses into a single. cumulus cloud or a cluster of clouds. As the cloud builds the transformation of water vapor into liquid or solid cloud particles releases large quantities of latent heat a process that keeps the rising air inside the cloud warmer (less dense) than the air surrounding it. The cloud continues to grow in the unstable atmosphere as long as it is constantly fed by rising air from below. In this manner a cumulus cloud may show extensive vertical development and grow into a towering cumulus cloud (cumulus congestus) in just a few minutes. During the cumulus stage there normally is insufficient time for precipitation to form and the updrafts keep water droplets and ice crystals suspended within the cloud. Also there is no lightning or thunder during this stage. As the cloud builds well above the freezing level the cloud particles grow larger and heavier as they collide and join with one another. Eventually the rising air is no longer able to keep them suspended and they begin to fall. While this phenomenon is taking place drier air from around the cloud is being drawn into it in a process called entrainment. The entrainment of drier air causes some of the raindrops to evaporate which chills the air. The air now colder and heavier than the air around it begins to descend as a downdraft . The downdraft may be enhanced as falling precipitation drags some of the air along with it. The appearance of the downdraft marks the beginning of the mature stage. During its mature stage the thunderstorm is most intense. The top of the cloud having reached a stable region of the atmosphere (which may be the stratosphere) begins to take on the familiar anvil shape as upper-level winds spread the cloud's ice crystals horizontally.  Lightning and thunder are also present in the mature stage. After the storm enters the mature stage it begins to dissipate in about 15 to 30 minutes. The dissipating stage occurs when the updrafts weaken as the gust front moves away from the storm and no longer enhances the updrafts. At this stage downdrafts tend to dominate throughout much of the cloud. The reason the storm does not normally last very long is that the downdrafts inside the cloud tend to cut off the storm's fuel supply by destroying the humid updrafts. Deprived of the rich supply of warm humid air cloud droplets no longer form.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
