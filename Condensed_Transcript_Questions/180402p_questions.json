This is often meaured by instrumented balloon.  The dry adiabatic lapse rate is the rate at which air temperature would drop with altitude due to expansion."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "689"}, "Question": {"S": "What are polar lows? How and where do they form? How do they produce hazardous weather for shipping?"}, "Answer": {"S": "Polar lows are cyclones that form poleward of the polar front. They form when frigid air from ice-covered land or water surfaces comes in contact with warmer air that was located over ice-free waters. Like hurricanes these smaller intense storms normally have a warmer central core strong winds (often gale force or higher) and heavy showery precipitation that unlike a hurricane is in the form of snow."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "562ee06f13a2bd0b0069df6c"}, "Question": {"S": "What type of air mass would be responsible for hot muggy summer weather in the eastern half of the United States?"}, "Answer": {"S": "B) mT"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) mP"}, {"S": "B) mT"}, {"S": "C) cP"}, {"S": "D) cT"}, {"S": "E) cA"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "938"}, "Question": {"S": "The wind around a surface high pressure center in the Northern Hemisphere blows:"}, "Answer": {"S": "C) clockwise and outward from the center"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) counterclockwise and outward from the center"}, {"S": "B) counterclockwise and inward toward the center"}, {"S": "C) clockwise and outward from the center"}, {"S": "D) clockwise and inward toward the center"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "56311a14dc73a80b008b03c9"}, "Question": {"S": "A city located on the east coast of the United States with hot muggy summers and mild winters (the average temperature of the coldest month is above -3 degrees C (27 degrees F) has a ____ climate."}, "Answer": {"S": "A) moist subtropical (Cfa) climate"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) moist subtropical (Cfa) climate"}, {"S": "B) mediterranean (Cs) climate"}, {"S": "C) tropical wet and dry climate (Aw)"}, {"S": "D) moist continental (Dfa)"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "5641524b2b15ed0b00ec385a"}, "Question": {"S": "The wind around a surface low pressure center in the Southern Hemisphere blows:"}, "Answer": {"S": "D) clockwise and inward toward the center"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) counterclockwise and outward from the center"}, {"S": "B) counterclockwise and inward toward the center"}, {"S": "C) clockwise and outward from the cente"}, {"S": "D) clockwise and inward toward the center"}]}}}]}}}
