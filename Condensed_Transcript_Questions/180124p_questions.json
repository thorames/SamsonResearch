How does the stability of the atmosphere determine whether these clouds will remain small or grow into cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms)?"}, "Answer": {"S": "As small cumulus clouds grow they shade the ground from the sun. This of course cuts off surface heating and upward convection. Without the continual supply of rising air the cloud begins to erode as its droplets evaporate. As the cloud dissipates (or moves along with the wind) surface heating begins again and regenerates another thermal which becomes a new cumulus. This is why you often see cumulus clouds form gradually disappear then reform in the same spot. The stability of the atmosphere above the base of the cumulus cloud plays a major role in determining the growth of the cloud. When a deep stable layer begins a short distance above the cloud base only fair-weather cumulus humilis are able to form. If a deep conditionally unstable layer exists above the cloud base cumulus congestus are likely to grow with billowing cauliflower-like tops. When the conditionally unstable layer is extremely deep - usually greater than 4 km (2.5 mi) - the cumulus congestus may even develop into a cumulonimbus - a thunderstorm."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563264bffe0e430b009baa80"}, "Question": {"S": "Clouds often form in the:"}, "Answer": {"S": "A) rising air in the center of a low pressure area"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) rising air in the center of a low pressure area"}, {"S": "B) rising air in the center of a high pressure area"}, {"S": "C) sinking air in the center of a low pressure area"}, {"S": "D) sinking air in the center of a high pressure area"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "563265b1fe0e430b009baa8f"}, "Question": {"S": "In a sky filled with scattered cumulus humilis clouds rising motions are found ________ the clouds and sinking motions are found ________ the clouds."}, "Answer": {"S": "B) under; between"}, "Choices": {"L": [{"S": "A) between; under"}, {"S": "B) under; between"}, {"S": "C) under; under"}, {"S": "D) between; between"}]}}}, {"M": {"QuestionID": {"S": "500"}, "Question": {"S": "Explain how mammatus clouds form."}, "Answer": {"S": "Downdrafts near a cumulonimbus (usually on the anvil) carry portion of cloud toward the ground."}, "Choices": {"L": []}}}]}}}
