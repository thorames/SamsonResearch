The wind speed increases rapidly with height producing strong wind speed shear. This type of shearing causes the cell inside the storm to tilt in such a way that the updraft actually rides up and over the downdraft.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 7 for Class 190930", "main": "What type of weather (cold/ warm wet/dry) would you expect over North America during a strong El Nino? During a strong La Nina?", "answer": "Such a large area of abnormally warm water can have an effect on global wind patterns. The warm tropical water fuels the atmosphere with additional warmth and moisture which the atmosphere turns into additional storminess and rainfall. The added warmth from the oceans and the release of latent heat during condensation apparently influence the westerly winds aloft in such a way that certain regions of the world experience too much rainfall and flooding whereas others have too little and experience drought. Meanwhile over the warm tropical central Pacific the frequency of typhoons usually increases. However over the tropical Atlantic between Africa and Central America strong winds aloft tend to disrupt the organization of thunderstorms that is necessary for hurricane development; hence there are fewer hurricanes in this region during strong El Nino events. During strong El Nino events there is a tendency for monsoon conditions over India to weaken.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 8 for Class 190930", "main": "During a major El Nino event:", "answer": "B) extensive ocean warming occurs over the tropical Pacific", "mcq": [{"option": "A) Peruvian fishermen harvest a record amount of fish near Christmas time", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 1}, {"option": "B) extensive ocean warming occurs over the tropical Pacific", "isAnswer": "true", "order": 2}, {"option": "C) the Northeast trade winds increase in strength", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 3}, {"option": "D) California experiences severe drought conditions", "isAnswer": "false", "order": 4}], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 9 for Class 190930", "main": "If the high winds of a hurricane are not responsible for inflicting the most damage what is?", "answer": "The huge waves and flooding associated with the storm surge usually cause the most destruction.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}, {"title": "Question 10 for Class 190930", "main": "Supercell thunderstorms that produce tornadoes form in a region of strong wind shear. Explain how the wind usually changes in speed and direction to produce this shear.", "answer": "Rapidly increasing wind speed with height provides vertical wind speed shear and the changing wind direction with height - from southerly at low levels to westerly at high levels - provides wind direction shear which induces the updrafts inside the storms to rotate.", "mcq": [], "multiselectMCQ": "false", "points": 1.0}]}
