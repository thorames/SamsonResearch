369,What is the average (standard) temperature lapse rate in the troposphere?,,The average (or standard) lapse rate in this region of the lower atmosphere is about 6.5 degrees Celsius for every 1000 meters (m) or about 3.6 degrees F for every 1000 ft rise in elevation.,
370,Explain the following:,,,
371,List the two most abundant gases in today's atmosphere. What percentage does each one occupy in a volume of dry air near the Earth's surface?,,N2: 78% O2: 21%,
372,List the most abundant greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere. What makes them greenhouse gases?,,Water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide chlorofluorocarbons.  They are greenhouse gases because they absorb a portion of the earth's outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back to earth.,
373,Briefly explain the production and natural destruction of carbon dioxide near the earth's surface. Give two reasons for the increase in carbon dioxide over the past 100 years or so.,,Carbon  (CO2) dioxide enters the atmosphere mainly from the decay of vegetation but it also comes from volcanic eruptions the exhalations of animal life from the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal oil and natural gas) and from deforestation.  The removal of CO2 from the atmosphere takes place during photosynthesis as plants consume CO2 to produce green matter.  The CO2 is then stored in roots branches and leaves.  The ocean acts as a huge reservoir for CO2 as phytoplankton (tiny drifting plants) in surface water fix CO2 into organic tissues.  Carbon dioxide that dissolves directly into surface water mixes downward and circulates through greater depths.  The increase in atmospheric CO2 appears to be due mainly to the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil; however deforestation also plays a role as cut timber burned or left to rot releases CO2 directly into the air perhaps accounting for about 20 percent of the observed increase. ,
374,Explain how ozone is a needed gas in the stratosphere but an unwanted gas near the Earth's surface.,,At the surface ozone (O3) is the primary ingredient of photochemical smog which irritates the eyes and throat and damages vegetation.

Here the concentration of O3 averages less than 0.002 percent by volume.  This small quantity is important however because it shields plants animals and humans from the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.,

420,What are some of the important roles that water vapor plays in our atmosphere?,,Water vapor is an extremely important gas in our atmosphere. Not only does it form into both liquid and solid cloud particles that grow in size and fall to earth as precipitation but it also releases large amounts of heat - called latent heat - when it changes from vapor into liquid water or ice. Latent heat is an important source of atmospheric energy especially for storms such as thunderstorms and hurricanes. Moreover water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas because it strongly absorbs a portion of the earth's outgoing radiant energy.,
421,Above what continent would you find the ozone hole?,,Antarctica,
423,How does weather differ from climate?,,When we talk about the weather we are talking about the condition of the atmosphere at any particular time and place. Climate represents the accumulation of daily and seasonal weather events (the average range of weather including extremes) over a long period of time.,
424,How does the Kelvin temperature scale differ from the Celsius scale? On a day when the outside air temperature is 273 K would this air be considered warm or cold?,,Each degree on the Kelvin scale is exactly the same size as a degree Celsius and a temperature of 0 K is equal to -273 degrees C. Converting from  degrees C to K can be done by simply adding 273 to the Celsius temperature. A temperature of 273K is the same as 0 degrees C or 32 degrees F which most people would consider cold.,
425,How does the average speed of air molecules relate to the air temperature?,,Higher temperatures correspond to faster average speeds and lower temperatures to slower average speeds.,
426,On the basis of temperature list the layers of the atmosphere from the lowest layer to the highest. Which layer is the coldest? The warmest? Which layer contains all of our weather?,,Troposphere stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere.  Coldest is at top of mesosphere and bottom of thermosphere warmest is in thermosphere.  All weather is in the troposphere.,
427,What is the average (standard) temperature lapse rate in the troposphere?,,The average (or standard) lapse rate in this region of the lower atmosphere is about 6.5 degrees Celsius for every 1000 meters (m) or about 3.6 degrees F for every 1000 ft rise in elevation.,
428,Explain the concept of air pressure in terms of mass of air above some level.,,The pressure at any level in the atmosphere may be measured in terms of the total mass of the air above any point.,
429,Why does air pressure always decrease with increasing height above the surface?,,"Near sea level atmospheric pressure decreases rapidly as air density is greatest whereas at high levels it decreases more slowly.""""",
430,Describe the three scales of motion when discussing wind and give an example of each.,,At the microscale eddies with diameters of a few meters or less not only disperse smoke they also sway branches and swirl dust and papers into the air. The circulation of city air constitutes the next largest scale - the mesoscale (meaning middle scale). Typical mesoscale winds range from a few kilometers to about a hundred kilometers in diameter. Generally they last longer than microscale motions often many minutes hours or in some cases as long as a day. Thunderstorms and tornadoes fall under the heading of mesoscale winds. In the largest scale or macroscale circulations dominate regions of hundreds to even thousands of square kilometers typically lasting days and sometimes weeks. ,
431,What causes the wind to blow?,,Wind will blow if there is a gradient in pressure in the horizontal.,
432,Does a north wind blow from the north toward the south or from the south toward the north?,,Wind direction is expressed in the direction from which the wind blows. A north wind for example blows from the north.,
433,Describe how the wind blows around areas of surface low- and high-pressure in the Northern Hemisphere.,,In the Northern Hemisphere surface winds blow counterclockwise and in toward an area of low pressure; they blow clockwise and outward around an area of high pressure.,
434,Why are clouds more common with areas of low pressure?,,As the surface air spins inward toward the area of low pressure it flows together and rises much like toothpaste does when its open tube is squeezed. The rising air cools and water vapor in the air condenses into clouds. Hence above areas of surface low pressure we often find clouds and precipitation. As the surface air flows outward away from the area of surface high pressure sinking air from above gradually replaces the laterally spreading surface air. Since sinking air does not usually produce clouds we find generally clear skies and fair weather associated with regions of high atmospheric pressure.,
435,Explain why condensation is more likely when the air temperature lowers.,,Condensation is more likely to happen as the air cools because the speed of the vapor molecules decreases. As the air temperature increases condensation is less likely because most of the molecules have sufficient speed (sufficient energy) to remain as a vapor.,
436,Define relative humidity and dew point.,,The relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapor actually in the air to the maximicron amount of water vapor required for saturation at that particular temperature (and pressure).,
437,If the air temperature is close to the dew point would the relative humidity be high or low? Explain.,,At the  dew point air will be saturated.  The closer temperature is to the dew point the closer it is to saturation.,
438,Briefly describe the movement of water in the hydrologic cycle.,,The hydrologic cycle can be thought of as beginning over the ocean where the sun's energy transforms enormous quantities of liquid water into water vapor. Winds then transport this invisible moist air to other regions where the water vapor condenses back into liquid forming cloud. Under certain conditions the liquid (or solid) cloud particles may grow in size and fall to the surface as precipitation - rain snow or hail. If the precipitation falls into an ocean the water is ready to begin its cycle again. If on the other hand the precipitation falls on a continent a great deal of the water returns to the ocean in a complex journey. This cycle of moving and transforming water molecules from liquid to vapor and back to liquid again is called the hydrologic (water) cycle. In the form with which we are most concerned water molecules travel from ocean to atmosphere to land and then back to the ocean.,
439,List some of the ways extreme weather and climate can influence our lives.,,Weather and climate often dictates the type of clothing we buy and wear. Climate determines when to plant crops as well as what type of crops can be planted. Weather determines if these same crops will grow to maturity. Perhaps their most immediate effect is on our comfort. In order to survive the cold of winter and heat of summer we build homes heat them air condition them insulate them- only to find that when we leave our shelter we are at the mercy of the weather elements. Even when we are dressed for the weather properly wind humidity and precipitation can change our perception of how cold or warm it feels. On a cold windy day the effects of wind chill tell us that it feels much colder than it really is and if not properly dressed we run the risk of frostbite or even hypothermia. On a hot humid day we normally feel uncomfortably warm and blame it on the humidity. If we become too warm our bodies overheat and heat exhaustion or heat stroke may result. ,
440,Distinguish between temperature and heat.,,Heat is energy in the process of being transferred from one object to another because of the temperature difference between them.,
441,What is kinetic energy?,,The kinetic energy (KE) of an object is equal to half its mass multiplied by its velocity squared. The faster something moves the greater its kinetic energy.,
442,In the atmosphere how does advection differ from convection?,,Advection is horizontal transport convection is vertical transport.,
443,How does the temperature of an object influence the radiation it emits?,,According to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law the amout of radiation an object emits is proportional to its temperature (in Kelvin) raised to the fourth power.,
444,How does the amount of radiation emitted by the earth differ from that emitted by the sun?,,The Sun's surface has a temperature of about 6000 degrees K while the Earth is near 300 degrees K.  If we raise each to the fourth power and compare we will find that the Sun emittes about 160000 times more energy that the Earth.,
445,When a body reaches a radiative equilibrium temperature what is taking place?,,When the rate of absorption of solar radiation equals the rate of emission of infrared earth radiation a state of radiative equilibrium is achieved.,
446,How do the wavelengths of most of the radiation emitted by the sun differ from those emitted by the surface of the earth?,,According to Wein's Law the wavelength of maxiumicron emission is inversely proportional to the temperature (in Kelvin). The Sun being about 6000 degrees K emits its maximicron energy at 0.5 micron while the Earth being around 300 degrees K emits its maximicron energy at around 10 D1514 wavelength.,
447,If the earth's surface continually radiates energy why doesn't it become colder and colder?,,The earth's surface is constantly absorbing radiation emitted by the sun.,
448,What are the most abundant selectively absorbing greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere?,,The most abundant is water vapor though it is variable.  The second most abundant is carbon dioxide.,
449,Explain how the earth's atmospheric greenhouse effect works.,,Water vapor and CO2 (and nitrous oxide methane and ozone) selectively emit radiation at infrared wavelengths. This radiation travels away from these gases in all directions. A portion of this energy is radiated toward the earth's surface and absorbed thus heating the ground. The earth in turn radiates infrared energy upward where it is absorbed by these gases warming the lower atmosphere. In this way the selectively-absorbing greenhouse gases absorb and radiate infrared energy and act as an insulating layer around the earth keeping part of the earth's infrared radiation from escaping rapidly into space. Consequently the earth's surface and the lower atmosphere are much warmer than they would be if these selectively absorbing gases were not present.,
450,What gases are responsible for the enhancement of the earth's greenhouse effect?,,Water vapor carbon dioxide nitrous oxide methane and CFCs.,
451,If the earth had no greenhouse effect would the earth's average surface temperature be higher or lower than it is presently? Explain.,,The outpouring of solar energy constantly bathes the earth with radiation while the earth in turn constantly emits infrared radiation. If we assume that there is no other method of transferring heat then when the rate of absorption of solar radiation equals the rate of emission of infrared earth radiation a state of radiative equilibrium is achieved. The average temperature at which this occurs is called the radiative equilibrium temperature. At this temperature the earth (behaving as a blackbody) is absorbing solar radiation and emitting infrared radiation at equal rates and its average temperature does not change. As the earth is about 150 million km (93 million mi) from the sun the earth's radiative equilibrium temperature is about 255 K (0 degrees F -18 degrees C).,
452,How is the lower atmosphere warmed from the surface upward?,,The selectively-absorbing greenhouse gases absorb and radiate infrared energy and act as an insulating layer around the earth keeping part of the earth's infrared radiation from escaping rapidly into space.,
453,Why does the albedo of the earth and its atmosphere average about 30 percent?,,On average the albedo of clouds is near 60 percent. When solar energy strikes a surface covered with snow up to 95 percent of the sunlight may be reflected. Water surfaces on the other hand reflect only a small amount of solar energy. Averaged for an entire year the earth and its atmosphere (including its clouds) will redirect about 30 percent of the sun's incoming radiation back to space.,
454,Explain how the earth and its atmosphere balance incoming energy with outgoing energy.,,Incoming solar radiation is absorbed warming the ground. The warm ground emits longwave (infrared) radiation much of which is absorbed in the atmosphere warming the atmosphere. The warm atmosphere radiates both out to space and back to the surface to balance the energy it has absorbed.,
455,What are the main factors that determine seasonal temperature variations?,,The elevation angle of the Sun dictates how much energy will be available to warm the ground.  The elevation angle depends on the time of year and is influenced by the tilt of the Earth.,
456,List the most abundant greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere. What makes them greenhouse gases?,,Water vapor carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide chlorofluorocarbons. They are greenhouse gases because they absorb a portion of the earth's outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back to earth.,
457,In the Northern Hemisphere why are summers warmer than winters even though the earth is actually closer to the sun in January?,,Because the difference in orbit is relatively minor compared to the greater variation over the year in solar elevation angle.,
458,If it is winter and January in New York City what is the season and month in Sydney Australia?,,It\'s still January but it's summertime.,
459,During the Northern Hemisphere's summer the daylight hours in far northern latitudes are longer than in middle latitudes. Explain why far northern latitudes are not warmer.,,Even though in the far north the sun is above the horizon for many hours during the summer the surface air there is not warmer than the air farther south where days are appreciably shorter. When incoming solar radiation (called insolation) enters the atmosphere fine dust air molecules and clouds reflect and scatter it and some of it is absorbed by atmospheric gases. Generally the greater the thickness of atmosphere that sunlight must penetrate the greater are the chance that it will be either reflected or absorbed by the atmosphere. During the summer in far northern latitudes the sun is never very high above the horizon so its radiant energy must pass through a thick portion of atmosphere before it reaches the earth's surface. Some of the solar energy that does reach the surface melts frozen soil or is reflected by snow or ice and that which is absorbed is spread over a large area. So even though northern cities may experience long hours of sunlight they are not warmer than cities farther south.,
460,Explain why average summer (January) temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere are cooler than average summer (July) temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere even though the earth is closer to the sun in January.,,Nearly 81 percent of the Southern Hemisphere surface is water compared to 61 percent in the Northern Hemisphere. The added solar energy due to the closeness of the sun is absorbed by large bodies of water becoming well mixed and circulated within them. This process keeps the average summer (January) temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere cooler than the average summer (July) temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere. The water's large heat capacity also tends to keep winters in the Southern Hemisphere warmer than we might expect. ,
461,What are some of the factors that determine the daily fluctuation of air temperature just above the ground?,,The amount of insolation albedo and heat capacity of the surface,
462,Explain how incoming energy and outgoing energy regulate the daily variation in air temperature.,,Warming occurs when incoming energy exceeds outgoing energy.  Cooling occurs when outgoing energy exceeds incoming energy.,
463,On a calm sunny day why is the air next to the ground normally much warmer than the air just above?,,Under calm conditions there is less mixing so the heating that happens at the surface is transferred to the atmophere via conduction which is an inefficient process compared to physical mixing.,
464,Explain why the warmest time of the day is usually in the afternoon even though the sun's rays are most direct at noon.,,At noon the energy being received from the Sun is still greater than what the ground is emitting as longwave radiation.  Hence there is an energy surplus and temperatures will rise until later in the day when incoming and outgoing radiation are equal.,
465,In the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere explain why even though the earth's surface receives maximum sunlight on June 21 (summer solstice) the warmest time of year typically occurs in July.,,At the time of the summer solstice the amount of solar energy available is greater than the loss of longwave radiation.  Only after the ground heats more and hence increases longwave radiation release and the solar radiation is diminished by a diminishing elevation angle is an equilibrium reached between energy gain and loss. At this balance temperatures reach a maximicron usually in late July or early August in Michigan.,
466,Explain how radiational cooling at night produces a radiation temperature inversion.,,The ground will cool fastest due to longwave radiation.  Conduction is an inefficient process so the cold is first transmitted to the air nearest the surface which cools the layer above it.  Hence the coldest air will be that in contact with the surface and air above it will generally be warmer than at the surface during the night.,
467,What weather conditions are best suited for the formation of a cold night and a strong radiation inversion?,,Clear skies and calm or very light winds.,
468,Explain why the daily range of temperature is normally greater in dry regions than in humid regions and on clear days than on cloudy days.,,In humid regions some of the Sun's energy goes into evaporating available water and hence is unavailable to heat the surface.,
469,Where is the hottest region in the United States? Where is the coldest?,,Hottest: southwest U.S.  Coldest: Alaska.,
470,Why is the hottest region of the world in the subtropical deserts of the Northern Hemisphere and not at the equator?,,At the equator the air tends to be more humid so more energy goes into evaporation.  Also at the equator there tend to be more clouds that will reflect sunlight from the surface.,
471,Why do the first freeze in autumn and the last freeze in spring occur in low-lying areas?,,Because these areas are closer to the earth's surface which is losing energy (cooling) by infrared radiation.,
472,Why is the largest annual range of temperature normally observed over continents away from large bodies of water?,,Continents are generally less humid as compared to oceans thus their temperature ranges tend to be larger than over oceans. The larger heat capacity of water as compared to land further moderates the temperature ranges.,
473,List the controls of temperature and then explain the influence each has on average global temperatures in January and July?,,Latitude: distance from the equator. Controls the sun elevation and length of day. In the northern hemisphere sun elevations are higher and days are longer in July. Land and water distribution: controls the heat capacity of the surface. Ocean currents: controls the horizontal mixing of heat. Elevation: controls the distance from the earth's surface which provides energy to the atmosphere.,
474,In cold weather how do increasing wind speeds make us feel colder than it actually is?,,Once the wind starts to blow the insulating layer of warm air is swept away and heat is rapidly removed from the skin by the constant bombardment of cold air.,
475,What conditions can bring on hypothermia?,,Cold wet and windy weather.,
476,On average where do we usually find the highest dew-point temperatures in the United States?,,In the southeast.,
477,Why is cold polar air described as 'dry' when the relative humidity of the air is very high?,,Because the very cold temperatures of polar air mean that the amount of water vapor required for saturation is very small. Since this amount is the denominator of the fraction in the RH equation a small value gives a large RH.,
478,Why is the wet-bulb temperature a good measure of how cool human skin can become?,,Because the wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature that can be reached by evaporating water into the air. On a hot day when the wet-bulb temperature is low rapid evaporation (and hence cooling) takes place at the skin's surface. As the wet-bulb temperature approaches the air temperature less cooling occurs and the skin temperature may begin to rise.When the wet-bulb temperature exceeds the skin's temperature no net evaporation occurs and the body temperature can rise quite rapidly. Fortunately most of the time the wet-bulb temperature is considerably below the temperature of the skin.,
479,When outside air is brought indoors on an extremely cold winter day the relative humidity of the heated air inside often drops below 10 percent. Explain why this situation occurs.,,At low temperatures the air can hold little moisture.  When that air enters the house in the winter it is warmed to the house temperature but no extra moisture is added so the relative humidity will be much lower tha outside.,
480,Explain how dew frozen dew and visible frost form.,,Dew: when the air cools to the dew point - the temperature at which saturation occurs. Frozen dew: If the air temperature should drop to freezing or below the dew will freeze becoming tiny beads of ice. Visible frost: forms on cold clear calm mornings when the dew-point temperature is at or below freezing. When the air temperature cools to the dew point (now called the frost point) and further cooling occurs water vapor can change directly to ice without becoming a liquid first - a process called deposition.,
481,How does haze differ from fog?,,Haze has greater visibilities.  Visibilities are less than 1 km with fog,
482,List two primary ways in which fog forms.,,Fog forms (1) by cooling - air is cooled below its saturation point (dew point) and (2) by evaporation and mixing - water vapor is added to the air by evaporation and the moist air mixes with relatively dry air.,
483,Describe the atmospheric conditions that are necessary for the formation of advection fog.,,Air that is near saturation (e.g. air that's been over the ocean or snowfields) is advected over a colder but moist surface.  This happens in the midwest in the spring when warm air begins to arrive from the south over existing snow fields.  The snow cools the air to saturation and adds more moisture producing think fogs.,
484,Describe the atmospheric conditions that are necessary for the formation of radiation fog,,Radiational cooling of the surface lowers the temperature to the dew point temperature.,
485,Describe the atmospheric conditions that are necessary for the formation of advection fog,,"Air passing over a colder and moist surface will both be cooled toward its dew point and have moisture added raising the dew point toward the temperature.""""",
486,When radiation fog 'burns off' what happens to the fog droplets?,,They evaporate.,
487,Explain how evaporation (mixing) fog forms.,,When two unsaturated bodies of air mix and the resulting mixture is saturated.,
488,Describe how steam fog on a road surface can lead to hazardous driving conditions especially when the sun is up.,,Steam fog may form above a wet surface on a sunny day. This type of fog is commonly observed after a rain shower as sunlight shines on a wet road heats the asphalt and quickly evaporates the water. This added vapor mixes with the air above producing steam fog. Fog that forms in this manner is short-lived and disappears as the road surface dries. However this type of fog can produce hazardous driving conditions (if just for an instant) especially when sunlight reflects off the fog into the driver's eyes. ,
489,List some of the adverse effects of fog.,,Poor visibility auto accidents ship navigation problems aviation fatalities acid fog (health problems) smog (health problems). ,
490,Describe the 'foggy areas' in the United States.,,Along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the Appalachian Mountains.,
491,Clouds are most generally classified by height above the earth's surface. List the major height categories and the cloud types associated with each.,,High: cirrus cirrostratus cirrocumulus. Middle: altostratus altocumulus.  Low: stratus stratocumulus nimbostratus. Vertical development: cumulus cumulonimbus,
492,List at least two distinguishable characteristics of each of the ten basic clouds.,,Cirrus: thin wispy long streamers feathery.  Cirrocumulus: small puffs grainy sometimes form in rows.  Cirrostratus: milky-white cause optical effects. Altostratus: gray or blue-gray sun dimly visible.  Altocumulus: gray puffy masses sometimes form in waves or bands.  Stratus: uniform grayish cloud covers entire sky.  Stratocumulus: low lumpy clouds appearing in rows or patches blue sky visible between clouds.  Nimbostratus: grey precipitating cloud light or moderate precipitation.  Cumulus: puffy cotton-ball appearance white blue sky between cloud elements.  Cumulonimbus: thunderstorm cloud over 10 km tall dark heavy precipitation sometimes severe weather.,
493,Why are high clouds normally thin? Why are they composed almost entirely of ice crystals?,,Because air at high altitudes is quite cold and dry.,
494,How can you distinguish altostratus from cirrostratus?,,Altocumulus have individual cells that are larger than cirrocumulus.  Cirrocumulus are thinner and brighter and generally cover only a small fraction of the sky.,
495,Which cloud is most oft en associated with severe weather such as strong surface winds hail and tornadoes?,,Cumulonimbus.,
496,A halo around the sun or moon often indicates that a midlatitude cyclonic storm may be approaching from the west. What cloud produces this halo?,,Altostratus.,
497,Explain how a lenticular cloud differs from a pileus cloud.,,Lenticular: lens-shaped clouds that form in the crest of a wave.  Pileus: forms when moist winds are deflected up and over the top of a building cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus.,
498,Why would a pilot not want to fly anywhere near a rotor cloud?,,A rotor cloud a large swirling extremely turbulent cloud with strong vertical motions can pose a major hazard to aircraft.,
499,Why does radiation fog usually 'burn off' by afternoon?,,Sunlight penetrates the fog and warms the ground causing the air temperature in contact with the ground to increase. The warm air rises and mixes with the foggy air above which increases the temperature of the foggy air. In the slightly warmer air some of the fog droplets evaporate allowing more sunlight to reach the ground which produces more heating and soon the fog completely disappears.,
500,Explain how mammatus clouds form.,,Downdrafts near a cumulonimbus (usually on the anvil) carry portion of cloud toward the ground.,
501,How do geostationary satellites differ from polar-orbiting satellites?,,Geostationary satellites orbit the equator at the same rate the earth spins.  Polar orbiting satellites pass over the north and south polar regions on each revolution.,
502,In an enhanced infrared satellite image how would thunderstorms appear?,,Normally cumulonimbus clouds with cold tops are assigned the darkest gray color.,
503,What is an adiabatic process?,,The addition/subtraction of heat from air without external heating/cooling.,
504,Why are moist and dry adiabatic rates of cooling different?,,Dry adiabatic rate is roughly 10 degrees C/km while the moist adiabatic rate is usually slower (around 6 degrees C/km) as condensation in the rising air adds latent heat.,
505,Under what conditions would the moist adiabatic rate of cooling be almost equal to the dry adiabatic rate?,,When there is an extremely small amount of moisture in the air.,
506,Explain the difference between environmental lapse rate and dry adiabatic rate.,,The environmental lapse rate is the actual decrease of temperature with altitude.  This is often meaured by instrumented balloon.  The dry adiabatic lapse rate is the rate at which air temperature would drop with altitude due to expansion.,
507,How would one normally obtain the environmental lapse rate?,,By comparing the air temperatures at two different altitudes.,
508,What is a stable atmosphere and how can it form?,,The atmosphere is stable when the environmental lapse rate is small - that is when the difference in temperature between the surface air and the air aloft is relatively small. Stable atmospheres form when surface air cools or higher-altitude air warms or both.,
509,Describe the general characteristics of clouds associated with stable and unstable atmospheres.,,Stable: cirrostratus altostratus nimbostratus or stratus. Unstable: vertical development clouds,
510,If the atmosphere is conditionally unstable what condition is necessary to bring on instability?,,Saturation,
511,Explain why cumulus clouds are conspicuously absent over a cool water surface.,,Because the air is not rising,
512,Why are cumulus clouds more frequently observed during the afternoon than at night?,,Because surface temperatures are generally warmer in the afternoon.,
513,Explain why an inversion represents an absolutely stable atmosphere.,,Because during an inversion the environmental lapse rate is not only small it's negative.,
514,How and why does lifting or lowering a layer of air change its stability?,,Lifting an air parcel expands it increases the environmental lapse rate causing instability. Lowering an air parcel compresses it decreases the environmental lapse rate causing stability.,
515,How does atmospheric stability influence the formation of lake effect snowstorms?,,Lake effect storms form when cold stable air passes over a warm moist surface.  The heat added from below causes the lapse rate to increase (become less stable) while the mositure added from below becomes the source of the eventual precipitation.,
516,List and explain several processes by which an unstable atmosphere can be made stable.,,The atmosphere tends to become more stable as the air aloft warms or the surface air cools. If the air aloft is being replaced by warmer air (warm advection) and the surface air is not changing appreciably the environmental lapse rate decreases and the air becomes stable. Similarly if the surface air cools and the aloft air temperature remains relatively constant the air becomes more stable.,
517,Why do cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms) often have flat tops?,,Cumulonimbus clouds can grow to such a height that they encounter the bottom of the stratosphere which is extremely stable with rising temperatures with altitude (inversion).  The rising cumulonimbus cannot enter the stratosphere and hence spread out horizontally into the anvil cloud.,
518,Is strong convection more likely in a stable or unstable atmosphere? Explain your reasoning.,,Strong convection is more likely in an unstable atmosphere because the strong surface heating a major cause of convection creates an unstable atmosphere. ,
519,Why are there usually large spaces of blue sky between cumulus clouds?,,Because the rising air within cumulus clouds is compensated for by downdrafts surrounding the clouds and water vapor does not condense when air sinks.,
520,On a warm sunny day the sky is dotted with small developing cumulus clouds. How does the stability of the atmosphere determine whether these clouds will remain small or grow into cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms)?,,As small cumulus clouds grow they shade the ground from the sun. This of course cuts off surface heating and upward convection. Without the continual supply of rising air the cloud begins to erode as its droplets evaporate. As the cloud dissipates (or moves along with the wind) surface heating begins again and regenerates another thermal which becomes a new cumulus. This is why you often see cumulus clouds form gradually disappear then reform in the same spot. The stability of the atmosphere above the base of the cumulus cloud plays a major role in determining the growth of the cloud. When a deep stable layer begins a short distance above the cloud base only fair-weather cumulus humilis are able to form. If a deep conditionally unstable layer exists above the cloud base cumulus congestus are likely to grow with billowing cauliflower-like tops. When the conditionally unstable layer is extremely deep - usually greater than 4 km (2.5 mi) - the cumulus congestus may even develop into a cumulonimbus - a thunderstorm.,
521,List four primary ways clouds form and describe the formation of one cloud type by each method.,,Surface heating and free convection: Air in contact with the warm surface becomes warmer than its surroundings and rises. Example: cumulus cloud. Topography: Horizontally moving air forced to rise over a mountain range. Example: orographic clouds which form on the upwind side of the range. Widespread ascent: Rising air due to convergence in low pressure systems. Example: stratocumulus and nimbostratus. Uplift along weather fronts: fronts lift the air causing adiabatic cooling condensation and clouds. Example: cumulonumbus clouds in the vicinity of a cold front.,
522,Explain why rain shadows form on the leeward side of mountains.,,Because the clouds and precipitation generally form on the upwind side of the range and by the time the air gets to the leeward side there's not much moisture left.,
523,Describe the necessary conditions for the formation of convective instability. How do you feel convective instability may play a role in the formation of intense thunderstorms?,,Convective instability is brought about by the lifting of a stable layer whose surface is humid and whose top is dry.  Convective instability is associated with the development of severe storms because these types of moisture conditions are often found in thunderstorm environments.,
524,Describe the conditions necessary to produce stratocumulus clouds by mixing.,,The air must be stable and close to saturation.,
525,If you see a sky full of altocumulus castellanus in the late afternoon what does this observation tell you about the stability of the atmosphere where the clouds have formed?,,Altocumulus castellanus clouds form when rising currents within the cloud extend into conditionally unstable air above the cloud. When altocumulus castellanus appear they indicate that the mid-level of the troposphere is becoming more unstable (destabilizing). So a morning sky full of altocumulus castellanus will likely become afternoon showers and even thunderstorms.,
526,Why are downslope winds on the leeward side of a high mountain range usually much warmer and drier than the upslope winds on the windward side?,,Air descending a mountain warms by compressional heating and upon reaching the surface can be much warmer than the air at the same level on the upwind side. The lower dew-point temperature and hence drier air on the leeward side are the result of water vapor condensing and then remaining as liquid cloud droplets and precipitation on the windward side.,
527,What is the primary difference between a cloud droplet and a raindrop?,,An ordinary cloud droplet is extremely small having an average diameter of 20 micron or 0.002 cm which is about 100 times smaller than a typical raindrop.,
528,Describe how the process of collision and coalescence produces precipitation.,,Cloud droplets produced initially through the 'solute effect' grow larger by collision with other cloud droplets and sticking (coalescence).  Given enough instances of collision and coalescence the droplets grow large enough to overcome cloud updrafts and fall to the ground.,
529,Would the collision-and-coalescence process work better at producing rain in a warm thick nimbostratus cloud or a warm towering cumulus congestus cloud? Explain.,,The cumulonimbus cloud because it's thicker giving more opportunity for cloud droplets to collide and coalesce.,
530,How does the ice-crystal (Bergeron) process produce precipitation? What is the main premise behind this process?,,In an environment of ice crystals and super-cooled cloud drops the ice will grow at the expense of the super-cooled drops  This occurs becuase the saturation vapor pressure required over ice is less than that required over water at the same temperature.,
531,Why do heavy showers usually fall from cumuliform clouds? Why does steady precipitation normally fall from stratiform clouds?,,Cumulonimbus clouds normally contain large convection currents causing heavy showers. Continuous rain usually falls from a layered cloud that covers a large area and has smaller vertical air currents.,
532,Explain the main principle behind cloud seeding.,,In clouds containing supercooled water the coices are to cool the air to -40 degrees C (using dry ice) or inject chemicals that replicate the crystalline properties of ice.,
533,How are clouds naturally seeded?,,When cirriform clouds lie directly above a lower cloud deck ice crystals may descend from the higher cloud and seed the cloud below. As the ice crystals mix into the lower cloud supercooled droplets are converted to ice crystals and the precipitation process is enhanced. Sometimes the ice crystals in the lower cloud may settle out leaving a clear area or 'hole' in the cloud.,
534,How does rain differ from drizzle?,,A falling drop of water must have a diameter equal to or greater than 0.5 mm (0.02 in.) to be considered rain. Fine uniform drops of water whose diameters are smaller than 0.5 mm are called drizzle.,
535,Why is it never too cold to snow?,,More water vapor will condense from warm saturated air than from cold saturated air. But no matter how cold the air becomes it always contains some water vapor that could produce snow. In fact tiny ice crystals have been observed falling at temperatures as low as 53 degrees F.,
536,Explain how snowflakes in a cloud grow large and heavy enough to fall toward the ground.,,During the ice-crystals (Bergeron) process ice crystals grow larger at the expense of the surrounding water droplets. In some clouds ice crystals might collide with supercooled liquid droplets. Upon contact the liquid droplets freeze into ice and stick together (accretion). The icy matter that forms is called graupel (or snow pellets). As the graupel falls it may fracture or splinter into tiny ice particles when it collides with cloud droplets. These splinters may then go on themselves to become new graupel which in turn may produce more splinters. In colder clouds the delicate ice crystals may collide with other crystals and fracture into smaller ice particles or tiny seeds which freeze hundreds of supercooled droplets on contact. In both cases a chain reaction may develop producing many ice crystals. As they fall they collide and stick to one another forming an aggregate of ice crystals called a snowflake.,
537,Describe some of the positive consequence of a snowfall.,,A blanket of snow is a good insulator (poor heat conductor).,
538,What is the difference between freezing rain and sleet?,,Sleet is water drops that refreeze on the way to the surface.  Freeing rain remains as rain but freezes on surface objects.  The difference is often dictated by the thickness of subfreezing temperatures above the surface.,
539,How does black ice form?,,Occasionally light rain drizzle or supercooled fog droplets will come in contact with surfaces such as bridges and overpasses that have cooled to a temperature below freezing. The tiny liquid droplets freeze on contact to the road surface or pavement producing a sheet of ice that oft en appears relatively dark. Such ice is usually called black ice. ,
540,Why are ice storms often responsible for the loss of power to many thousands and sometimes millions of people?,,A thick coating of ice on power lines can cause them to break and fall. Also thick coatings of ice on trees can cause them to topple onto power lines.,
541,Describe how icing can be hazardous to aircraft.,,A major hazard to aviation icing reduces aircraft e?ciency by increasing weight. Icing has other adverse effects depending on where it forms. On a wing or fuselage ice can disrupt the air fow and decrease the plane's flying capability. When ice forms in the air intake of the engine it robs the engine of air causing a reduction in power. Icing may also affect the operation of brakes landing gear and instruments.,
542,List and explain several processes by which a stable atmosphere can be made unstable.,,Any process that creates a steeper lapse rate will cause the air to become less stable.  This could be warming near the surface or cooling aloft or both.,
543,Describe how hail might form in a cumulonimbus cloud.,,Hail is produced in a cumulonimbus cloud when graupel large frozen raindrops or just about any particles (even insects) act as embryos that grow by accumulating supercooled liquid droplets. Violent upsurging air currents within the cloud carry small embryos high above the freezing level. As the embryos pass through regions of varying liquid water content a coating of ice forms around them and they grow larger and larger. When the ice particles are appreciable size they become too large and heavy to be supported by the rising air and they then begin to fall as hail. As they slowly descend the hailstones may get caught in a violent updraft only to be carried upward once again to repeat the cycle.,
544,Why is hail more common in summer than in winter?,,Because cumulonimbus clouds (thunderstorms) are more common in summer.,
545,How do the atmospheric conditions that produce sleet differ from those that produce hail?,,For sleet to form surface temperatures must be below freezing. Surface temperatures are typically well above freezing during hailstorms.,
546,Where are the wettest and driest regions of the world located?,,Wettest: Mawsynram on the crest of the southern slopes of the Khasi Hills in northeastern India is considered the wettest place in the world as it receives an average of 467 inches of rainfall each year the majority of which falls during the summer monsoon between April and October. Dryest: the driest regions of the world lie in the frigid polar region the leeward side of mountains and in the belt of subtropical high pressure between 15 degrees  and 30 degrees  latitude. Africa and northern Chile holds the world record for lowest annual rainfall - 0.03 inches.',
547,Explain how mountains influence precipitation.,,The topography of mountains forces air to rise. Rising air must cool adiabatically so it is possible that the air will cool to the point where clouds will form.,
548,Describe how a rain shadow forms.,,As air descends and warms along the leeward side of a mountain range there is less likelihood of clouds and precipitation. Thus the leeward (downwind) side of mountains tends to be 'dry.' A region on the leeward side of a mountain where precipitation is noticeably less is called a rain shadow.,
549,Explain several ways a flash flood might form.,,,
550,The Palmer Drought Severity Index uses what weather elements to assess drought severity?,,Average temperature and precipitation values.,
551,Why does air pressure decrease with height more rapidly in cold air than in warm air?,,Warm air expands creating a less dense atmosphere.  With lower density we must travel farther to include the same number of molecules so the pressure of the column decreases more slowly with altitude in warmer air.,
552,What can cause the air pressure to change at the bottom of a column of air?,,It takes a shorter column of cold more-dense air to exert the same surface pressure as a taller column of warm less-dense air.,
553,On an upper-level chart is cold air aloft generally associated with low or high pressure? What about warm air aloft ?,,Cold air aloft: low pressure.  Warm air aloft: high pressure.,
554,How does sea-level pressure differ from station pressure? Can the two ever be the same?,,Sea-level pressure is the pressure a station would attain if it were lowered to sea level.  The estimation of what sea level pressure is at each city allows a comparison of pressures at the same elevation which contriols wind flow.,
555,What is the force that initially sets the air in motion?,,Pressure gradient force,
556,What do Newton's first and second laws of motion tell us?,,Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion (and travel at a constant velocity along a straight line) as long as no force is exerted on the object. So to start air moving to speed it up to slow it down or even to change its direction requires the action of an external force. Newton's second law states that the force exerted on an object equals its mass times the acceleration produced. From this relationship we can see that when the mass of an object is constant the force acting on the object is directly related to the acceleration that is produced.,
557,Explain why in the Northern Hemisphere the average height of contour lines on an upperlevel isobaric chart tend to decrease northward.,,Because temperatures tend to decrease as you go northward (in the Northern Hemisphere).,
558,How does a steep (or strong) pressure gradient appear on a weather map?,,A strong pressure gradient is represented as isobars close together.,
559,Explain why on a map closely spaced isobars (or contours) indicate strong winds and widely spaced isobars (or contours) indicate weak winds.,,Closely-spaced isobars indicate a strong pressure gradient and strong pressure gradients cause strong winds.,
560,What is a geostrophic wind? Why would you not expect to observe a geostrophic wind at the equator?,,A geostrophic wind is a wind caused by a balance of pressure gradient force and Coriolis force.  There cannot be a geostrophic balance at the equator as there is no Coriolis force there.,
561,Why do upper-level winds in the middle latitudes of both hemispheres generally blow from the west?,,Because winds at these altitudes are approximately geostrophic with higher pressures (warmer temperatures) to the south and lower pressures (colder temperatures) to the north.,
562,Describe how the wind blows around highs and lows aloft and near the surface in the Northern Hemisphere.,,In the Northern Hemisphere air moves in a circular and counter-clockwise manner around low pressure aloft.  At the surface air spirals into the low pressure system in a counter-clockwise manner.,
563,On a surface weather map why do the winds cross the isobars?,,Friction slows the wind hence reducing the effect of the Coriolis force allowing the pressure gradient force to draw air toward the center of the low.,
564,Describe the type of vertical air motions associated with surface high- and low-pressure areas.,,Highs: descending air.  Lows: ascending air.,
565,If clouds above you are moving from southwest to northeast in which general direction would you expect to find an upperlevel low pressure area? If the surface wind on this same day is blowing from the southeast in which general direction would you expect?,,To the northwest. To the west.,
566,How are wind-sculpted flag trees able to show the prevailing wind?,,In the high country strong prevailing winds can bend and twist tree branches toward the downwind side producing wind-sculptured 'flag trees.',
567,With the same wind speed explain why a camper is more easily moved by the wind than a car?,,Wind striking an object exerts a pressure on it. The amount of pressure depends upon the object's shape and size and also on the amount of reduced pressure that exists on the object's downwind side. A camper has a larger area than a car and thus will experience a greater force by the wind. Also the pressure drop on the downwind side will be greater for the camper than for the car allowing the camper to be moved further.,
568,What are the necessary conditions for the development of large wind waves?,,Wind waves are created as the frictional drag of the wind transfers energy to the water surface below.,
569,How can a coastal area have huge damaging waves on a clear non-stormy day?,,Strong winds far offshore can create waves which extend for many miles even to areas which are not experiencing strong winds.,
570,Explain how seiches can form.,,When strong winds blow over an open body of water such as a lake it can cause the water to slosh back and forth rhythmically causing a seiche.,
571,What conditions are necessary for upwelling to occur along the west coast of North America? How does upwelling influence the formation of fog?,,Northerly winds along the West Coast cause upwelling. As the deeper colder water rises to the surface it cools the air directly above the water. Fog commonly occurs as the surface air cools to its dew point temperature.,
572,It is unlikely that near sea-level winds will ever exceed 225 mi/ hr yet the highest wind speed ever measured at the earth's surface is 231 mi/hr. Explain this apparent paradox.,,Wind speeds in excess of 225 miles/hour are possible on mountaintops in areas that may locally funnel winds into narrow valleys and in rapidly rotating violent tornadoes.,
573,If the earth did not rotate how would surface winds tend to blow?,,If the earth did not rotate there would be no Coriolis force.  Air would expand on the warm side of the earth (towards the sun) causing a high pressure aloft.  Air would flow aloft toward the cold side and hence add mass to the cold area causing surface pressure there to rise.  The higher pressure at the surface would cause flow back to the warm side.,
574,Why do large thunderstorms and heavy rain showers form along the ITCZ?,,The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) marks the line where the northeast trade winds converge into the southeast trade winds.  The converging winds force upward motions and clouds and precipitation.,
575,On a large circle place the major surface pressure systems and major wind belts of the world at the approximate latitudes.,,,
576,Why would you not expect a region of 'horse latitudes' to form over the North Atlantic Ocean near 50 degrees N?,,Winds are not weak in this region.,
577,What are some of the negative consequences of an extensive drought?,,Drought can damage crops and have an adverse impact on a community's water supply. Prolonged drought especially when accompanied by high temperatures can lead to a shortage of food and in some places widespread starvation.,
578,Most of the United States is in what wind belt?,,Prevailing westerlies.,
579,Explain how and why the average surface pressure features shift from summer to winter.,,When we compare the January and July maps we can see several changes in the semipermanent pressure systems. The strong subpolar lows so well developed in January over the Northern Hemisphere are hardly discernible on the July map. The subtropical highs however remain dominant in both seasons. Because the sun is overhead in the Northern Hemisphere in July and overhead in the Southern Hemisphere in January the zone of maximicron surface heating shifts seasonally. In response to this shift the major pressure systems wind belts and ITCZ shift toward the north in July and toward the south in January.,
580,Describe how the general circulation helps to explain zones of abundant and sparse precipitation along a line that runs from the equator to the poles.,,The Hadley cell results from rising air at the equator that sinks at around 30 degrees  latitude.  Rising air causes clouds and precipitation while sinking air reduces cloud cover so 30 degrees  ends to be the latitude where many deserts are found.  Air moving poleward from 30 degrees  runs into air flowing from the poles at around 50 degrees  and is forced upward along the polar front maing this a relatively wet region.  The poles tend to be regions of subsidence and tend to be much drier.,
581,Why are summers dry in Southern California and wet in southern Georgia?,,The Bermuda high causes onshoer winds from the south onto Georgia passing over the warm waters of the Atlantic. The Pacific high leads to onshore flow from the northwest in California passing over the cold waters of the California current.,
582,Explain the following:,,,
585,Why are thunderstorms more likely to form over land with a sea breeze and more likely to form over water with a strong land breeze?,,The rising air is over the land during the day (sea breeze) and over the water during the night (land breeze).,
586,Explain why cities in India such as Cherrapunji normally receive over 90 percent of their rainfall between April and October.,,During the summer monsoon in India the air flowing from the ocean toward the continent becomes much warmer than it was when it was above the water. A shallow low-pressure area develops over the continental interior. The heated air within the low rises and the surrounding air responds by flowing counterclockwise into the low center. This condition results in moisture-bearing winds sweeping into the continent from the ocean. The humid air converges with a drier westerly flow causing it to rise; further lifting is provided by hills and mountains. Lifting cools the air to its saturation point resulting in heavy showers and thunderstorms. Thus the summer monsoon of southeastern Asia which lasts from about June through September means wet rainy weather (wet season) with winds that blow from sea to land.,
587,What is a monsoon wind system and how does it form over India?,,During the winter the air over the continent becomes much colder than the air over the ocean. A large shallow high-pressure area develops over continental Siberia producing a clockwise circulation of air that flows out over the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Subsiding air of the anticyclone and the downslope movement of northeasterly winds from the inland plateau provide eastern and southern Asia with generally fair weather. Hence the winter monsoon which lasts from about December through February means clear skies (dry season) with winds that blow from land to sea. In summer the wind flow pattern reverses itself as air over the continents becomes much warmer than air above the water. A shallow thermal low develops over the continental interior. ,
588,You are fly-fishing in a mountain stream during the early morning: Would you expect the wind to be blowing upstream or downstream? Explain.,,Downstream.  A mountain/valley breeze system experiences mountain breezes at night and valley breezes during the day.,
589,Which wind will most likely produce thunderstorms: A valley breeze or a mountain breeze? Why?,,Valley breeze because rising air will expand and cool adiabatically.,
590,If katabatic winds blow downslope why aren't they warm?,,The ideal setting for a katabatic wind is an elevated plateau surrounded by mountains with an opening that slopes rapidly downhill. When winter snows accumulate on the plateau the overlying air grows extremely cold and a shallow dome of high pressure forms near the surface. Along the edge of the plateau the horizontal pressure gradient force is usually strong enough to cause the cold air to flow across the isobars through gaps and saddles in the hills. Along the slopes of the plateau the wind continues downhill as a gentle or moderate cold breeze. If the horizontal pressure gradient increases substantially such as when a storm approaches or if the wind is confined to a narrow canyon or channel the flow of air can increase often destructively as cold air rushes down-slope like water flowing over a waterfall. Even though the sinking air warms by compression it is so cold to begin with that it isn't much warmer than the air it replaces.,
591,Explain why chinook winds are warm and dry.,,Chinook winds blow down mountainslopes. As air descends it warms adiabatically. Chinook winds are dry because the air's moisture is lost as the air ascends on the upwind side of the mountain.,
592,What conditions must be in place for chinook winds to produce extreme temperature fluctuations?,,The rocking motion of a mass of cold air can cause extreme temperature variations for cities located at the base of hills along the periphery of the cold air-warm air boundary as they are alternately in and then out of the cold air.,
593,Why are chinook winds called 'snow eaters'?,,As a strong chinook wind moves over a heavy snow cover it can melt and evaporate a foot of snow in less than a day.,
594,Why are haboobs more prevalent in Arizona than in Arkansas?,,Because there is more sand and dust in Arizona.,
595,Describe how dust devils normally form.,,Dust devils form on clear hot days over a dry surface where most of the sunlight goes into heating the surface rather than evaporating water from vegetation. The atmosphere directly above the hot surface becomes unstable convection sets in and the heated air rises. Wind often deflected by small topographic barriers flows into this region rotating the rising air. Depending on the nature of the topographic feature the spin of a dust devil around its central eye may be cyclonic or anticyclonic and both directions occur with about equal frequency.,
596,Describe the characteristics of a good air mass source region.,,A source region should be generally flat and of uniform composition with light surface winds. The longer the air remains stagnant over its source region or the longer the path over which the air moves the more likely it will acquire properties of the surface below.,
597,What atmospheric conditions contribute to the development of a strong Santa Ana wind in Southern California? Why is a Santa Ana wind warm? Why is it also dry?,,As air descends from the elevated desert plateau it funnels through mountain canyons in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains finally spreading over the Los Angeles basin and San Fernando Valley. The wind often blows with exceptional speed in the Santa Ana Canyon (the canyon from which it derives its name). These warm dry winds develop as a region of high pressure builds over the Great Basin. The clockwise circulation around the anticyclone forces air downslope from the high plateau. Santa Ana winds are warm because of compressional heating of the already warm dry desert air.,
598,What air mass brings the coldest winter weather to the United States ?,,Continental polar.,
599,Why is continental polar air welcome to the Central Plains in summer but not welcome in the winter?,,cP air is responsible for extremely cold temperatures during winter and refreshing cool temperatures in summer.,
600,List the temperature and moisture characteristics of each of the major air masses.,,Source Region Polar(P) Tropical(T)  Land cP cT  Continental (c)  cold dry stable  hot dry stable air aloft; unstable surface air  Source Region Polar(P) Tropical(T)  Land cP cT  Continental (c)  cold dry stable  hot dry stable air aloft; unstable surface air    Water mP mT  Maritime (m)  cool moist unstable  warm moist usually unstable,

617,Explain the following:,,,
618,Explain why during a summer day the relative humidity will change as shown in Fig. 3.19 p. 82.,,As temperatures increase the amount of water vapor required for saturation increases.  Since this represents the denominator of the fraction in the RH equation RH must be inversely proportional to temperature.,
619,Why do hot humid summer days usually feel hotter than hot dry summer days?,,When the air temperature is high and the relative humidity low perspiration on the skin evaporates quickly often making us feel that the air temperature is lower than it really is.  However when both the air temperature and relative humidity are high and the air is nearly saturated with water vapor body moisture does not readily evaporate; instead it collects on the skin as beads of perspiration. Less evaporation means less cooling and so we usually feel warmer than we did with a similar air temperature but a lower relative humidity.,
620,Why is it very unlikely that you will ever experience a temperature of 90 degrees F with a relative humidity of 90 percent?,,A temperature of 90 degrees F and a relative humidity of 90 percent can occur only if the dew-point temperature is very high (nearly 87 degrees F) and a dew-point temperature this high rarely occurs in the United States even on the muggiest of days.,
621,What is the heat index for each set of conditions?  Which do you feel produces the highest heat index?,,,

644,What does the Coriolis force do to moving air: ,,,
645,Explain the following:,,,
646,Why is the polar jet stream stronger in winter than in summer?,,The equator-to-pole temperature gradient is stronger in winter than in summer.,
647,Explain how wind shear in the vicinity of a jet stream can produce severe aircraft turbulence even in clear air?,,Wind shear is the change in wind speed or direction with increasing altitude.  When the shear exceeds a critical value waves break into large swirls with significant vertical movement.  When this happens in clear air it's called clear air turbulence.,
648,Explain the following:,,,
649,In what part of the world would you most likely experience each of the following extreme winds and what type of weather would each wind bring with it? ,,,
650,Explain how arctic outbreaks can occur in the southern part of the United States. Where did the arctic air originate and how is it able to move this far south?,,When upper-level winds have a strong north-south trajectory cold arctic air can travel as far south as the southern United States.,
651,In mountainous country would afternoon thunderstorms be more likely with a maritime tropical air mass or with a continental tropical air mass? Explain.,,Maritime tropical because the moisture will condense as air rises over a mountain range.,
652,Why do air temperatures tend to be a little higher on the eastern side of the Appalachian Mountains than on the western side even though the same winter continental polar or continental arctic air mass dominates both areas?,,Southward-moving air rides up and over the lower Appalachian Mountains.  Turbulent mixing and compressional heating increase the air temperatures on the downwind side.  Consequently cities located to the east of the Appalachian Mountains usually do not experience temperatures as low as those on the west side.,
653,Explain how the airflow aloft regulates the movement of air masses.,,After the air mass spends some time over its source region it usually begins to move in response to the winds aloft.  As it moves away from its source region the air mass encounters surfaces that may be warmer or colder.  When the air mass is colder than the underlying surface it is warmed from below which results in a steeper lapse rate and instability at low levels.  In this case increased convection and turbulent mixing near the surface usually produce good visibility cumuliform clouds and showers of rain or snow.  On the other hand when the air mass is warmer than the surface below the lower layers are chilled by contact with the cold earth.  Warm air above cooler air produces a stable lapse rate with little vertical mixing.  This causes the accumulation of dust smoke and pollutants which restricts surface visibilities.  In moist air stratiform clouds accompanied by drizzle or fog may form.,
654,Why are maritime polar air masses along the East Coast of the United States usually colder than those along the nation's West Coast? Why are they also less prevalent?,,They are colder because North Atlantic waters are very cold and the travel distance is short compared to the west coast situation.  Since the prevailing winds aloft are westerly Atlantic mP air masses are less common than Pacific ones.,
655,The boundaries between neighboring air masses tend to be more distinct during the winter than during the summer. Explain why.,,In summer the difference in temperatures between tropics and mid-latitudes are less pronounced as the sun is located over northern latitudes. In winter with the sun over latitudes in the southern hemipshere temeprature differences are much more pronounced.,
656,When a very cold air mass covers half of the United States a very warm air mass frequently covers the other half. Explain how and why this situation often happens.,,As illustrated in Figure 9.9 a typical late winter/early spring weather pattern involves a stationary front oriented in a west-to-east direction.  North of this front northeasterly winds provide generally cold air whereas the southwesterly winds south of the front provide warm humid air.,
657,What type of air mass would be responsible for the weather conditions listed as follows? ,,,
658,Sketch side views of a typical cold front warm front and cold-occluded front. Include in each diagram cloud types and patterns areas of precipitation surface winds and relative temperature on each side of the front.,,,
659,In winter the most extreme change in air temperature across a cold front will occur when the front separates what two air masses?,,Continental polar and maritime tropical.,
660,On a surface weather map what do you know about a region where the word frontogenesis is marked?,,Frontogenesis refers to an area where a front is strengthening.,
661,Explain why barometric pressure usually falls with the approach of a cold front or occluded front.,,A cold front is a trough of low pressure.,
662,How does the weather usually change along a dryline? Since hot dry air is often located behind (to the west) of a dryline why are drylines not classified as warm fronts?,,The dew points change markedly.  Dry lines separate dry and moist air rather than warm and cool air.,
663,Based on the following weather forecasts what type of front will most likely pass the area? ,,,
664,During the spring on a warm sunny day in Boston Massachusetts the wind shift s from southwesterly to northeasterly and the weather turns cold damp and overcast. What type of front moved through the Boston area? From what direction did the front appear?,,A back-door cold front moved in from the northeast.,
665,Why are ice storms more likely to form with a warm front than with a cold front?,,Warm air rides up over cold dry surface air causing clouds and precipitation.  When rain falls into the shallow layer of cold air beneath it may evaporate chilling the air even more.  Sometimes the rain freezes before reaching the ground producing sleet.  Other times the rain freezes on impact producing freezing rain.  If the frozen precipitation happens for many hours the result is an ice storm.,
666,In winter cold-front weather is typically more violent than warm-front weather. Why? Explain why this situation is not necessarily true in summer.,,The temperature contrast across a wintertime cold front can be much larger than the contrast across a summertime cold front.  The most violent weather occurs when the temperature contrast is larger.,
667,Why are mid-latitude cyclonic storms called 'extratropical cyclones'?,,A middle-latitude cyclonic storm is a storm that forms at middle and high latitudes outside of the tropics. ,
668,On a piece of paper draw the different stages of a mid- latitude cyclonic storm as it goes through birth to decay according to the polar front (Norwegian) model.,,,
669,Why do some mid-latitude cyclones quickly 'die out' after they become occluded?,,The divergence aloft which removes air over the cyclone follows the place where temeprature contrast at the surface is greatest. Afterr the storm occludes the location of greatest temperature contrast shifts away from the center of the cyclone.,
670,List four regions in North America where mid-latitude cyclones tend to develop or redevelop.,,<ul> 	<li>Downwind of Canadian Rockies: Alberta Clipper</li> 	<li>Downwind of US Rockies: Colorado Low</li> 	<li>Gulf of Mexico: Gulf Low</li> 	<li>Along East Coast: Hatteras Low</li> </ul>,
671,What are northeasters (nor'easters)? Why are they given that name? What type of extreme weather do nor'easters bring to northeastern North America? In Fig. 10.5a p. 275 which of the low-pressure areas on the map could develop into nor'easters?,,The air flow in advance of a Hatteras low will be onshore due to counterclockwise flow. This air will carry moisture of mP air onshore and is often responsible for much of the snowfall in the storm hence the worst of the snow will be associated with winds from the northeast hence a nor'easter.,
672,What is an Alberta Clipper? Where does it form and how does it move?,,A cyclone forming on the eastern side of the Rockies in Alberta Canada then rapidly skirting across the northern tier states.,
673,Explain how converging air and diverging air forms at the surface and aloft.,,(a) Surface air converges towards the center of a low and diverges from the center of a high.    (b) a region of converging air usually forms on the west side of an upper-level trough and a region of diverging air forms on the east side. ,
674,Explain this fact: Without upper-level divergence a surface open wave cyclone would probably persist for less than a day.,,Air spirals into a surface low due to the effect of friction on air flow. Unless divergence exists above the low it will fill in quickly and dissipate.,
675,If upper-level diverging air above a surface area of low pressure exceeds converging air around the surface low will the surface low-pressure area weaken or intensify? Explain.,,It will intensify.  When upper-level divergence is stronger than surface convergence surface pressures drop and the low intensifies.,
676,How are longwaves in the upper-level westerlies different from shortwaves?,,Longwaves are many thousands of kilometers long; shortwaves are small disturbances or ripples.,
677,What are the necessary ingredients for a mid-latitude cyclonic storm to develop into a huge storm system?,,Upper-level divergence (usually associated with a shortwave) surface convergence strong horizontal temperature contrast temperature advection.,
678,Why do surface storms tend to dissipate ('fill') when the upper-level low and the surface low become vertically stacked?,,Under these circumstances no significant temperature advection is occurring. Without the necessary energy transformations associated with temperature advection the surface system gradually dissipates. As its winds slacken and its central pressure gradually rises the low is said to be filling.,
679,How does cold advection differ from warm advection?,,As the name implies cold advection is the movement of clod air into a warmer area.,
680,How does the polar jet stream influence the formation of a mid-latitude cyclone?,,The polar front jet stream provides areas of divergence aloft.,
681,Explain why even though the polar jet stream coincides with the polar front some surface regions are more favorable for the development of mid-latitude cyclones than others.,,Jet streaks along the polar front jet stream provide areas of strong convergence and divergence.,
682,Using a diagram explain why a surface high-pressure area over North Dakota will typically move southeastward while at the same time a deep mid-latitude cyclone over the Great Lakes will generally move northeastward.,,,
683,What are the sources of energy for a developing mid-latitude cyclone?,,Rising and sinking air in regions of convergence and divergence (conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy) radiation to space from the tops of clouds latent heat release.,
684,What are the roles of warm cold and dry conveyor belts in the development of a mid- latitude cyclonic storm system?,,Warm conveyor belt: originates at the surface in the warm sector ahead of the cold front. As the warm airstream moves northward it slowly rises along the sloping warm front. Water vapor in the rising air condenses and clouds form. Aloft the warm air flow gradually turns toward the northeast or east parallel to the upper-level flow. The rising warm air causes cloudiness to appear ahead of the surface low and its surface warm front. From these clouds rain or snow usually falls. Directly below the warm conveyor belt a cold moist airstream the cold conveyor belt moves slowly westward north of the surface low and the warm front. As the airstream moves into the vicinity of the surface low rising air gradually forces the cold conveyor belt upward. The rising airstream usually turns as it ascends producing a comma shaped cloud. If the airstream rises high enough it gets caught in the southwesterly flow aloft and swings northeastward. The last conveyor belt is a dry one that forms in the upper atmosphere. Called the dry conveyor belt this airstream slowly descends from the northwest behind the surface cold front where it brings generally clearing weather. If a branch of this dry air sweeps into the storm it produces a clear area that in the comma cloud appears to pinch off the comma's head from its tail. This phenomenon tends to show up on satellite pictures as the storm becomes more fully developed.,
685,Why was the March Storm of 1993 given a Category 5 ranking on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS)?,,It had a NESIS value of 13.2 due to extremely low pressure strong winds and heavy precipitation.,
686,Describe the weather conditions necessary for a blizzard to form over the northern Great Plains.,,A blizzard implies strong winds hence the storm requires a strong pressure gradient.  A strong pressure gradient will occur when the central pressure of the storm is exceptionally low which can occur is exceptionally strong divergence occurs over the cyclone.  To get a strong divergence requires a strong jet stream which in turn requires an intense temperature gradient at the surface.,
687,On a satellite image of a midlatitude cyclonic storm where would you look for a wraparound band of clouds and precipitation?,,To the north of the low.,
688,If you are stuck in a stranded car in a blizzard what items would you want to have with you? Would it be wise to leave your car and seek help? Explain.,,You should carry a winter weather survival kit that includes blankets and sleeping bags extra clothing a flashlight and batteries a knife high-calorie non-perishable foods drinking water several large candles matches or a lighter a can for melting snow for extra drinking water a bag of sand or cat litter a shovel first aid kit a tow rope jumper cables a compass several flares a tool kit a fully charged cell phone and a large container with a cover for sanitary purposes. If you are inside a stranded vehicle do not go outside and start walking. The odds of surviving the ordeal are much greater if you stay inside your vehicle away from the strong winds and blowing snow. Not only will the vehicle protect you form the extremely low wind-chill temperature but it will also trap some of your body heat thus keeping the inside air warmer than the outside air. Moreover people outside in a blizzard often become disoriented by the blinding snow and are unable to find their way back to their vehicle.,
689,What are polar lows? How and where do they form? How do they produce hazardous weather for shipping?,,Polar lows are cyclones that form poleward of the polar front. They form when frigid air from ice-covered land or water surfaces comes in contact with warmer air that was located over ice-free waters. Like hurricanes these smaller intense storms normally have a warmer central core strong winds (often gale force or higher) and heavy showery precipitation that unlike a hurricane is in the form of snow.,
690,What are thunderstorms?,,A storm containing lightning and thunder.,
691,What atmospheric conditions are necessary for the development of ordinary cell thunderstorms?,,Warm humid air masses away from significant weather fronts.,
692,Describe the stages of development of an ordinary cell (air mass) thunderstorm.,,The first stage is known as the cumulus stage or growth stage. As a parcel of warm humid air rises it cools and condenses into a single. cumulus cloud or a cluster of clouds. As the cloud builds the transformation of water vapor into liquid or solid cloud particles releases large quantities of latent heat a process that keeps the rising air inside the cloud warmer (less dense) than the air surrounding it. The cloud continues to grow in the unstable atmosphere as long as it is constantly fed by rising air from below. In this manner a cumulus cloud may show extensive vertical development and grow into a towering cumulus cloud (cumulus congestus) in just a few minutes. During the cumulus stage there normally is insufficient time for precipitation to form and the updrafts keep water droplets and ice crystals suspended within the cloud. Also there is no lightning or thunder during this stage. As the cloud builds well above the freezing level the cloud particles grow larger and heavier as they collide and join with one another. Eventually the rising air is no longer able to keep them suspended and they begin to fall. While this phenomenon is taking place drier air from around the cloud is being drawn into it in a process called entrainment. The entrainment of drier air causes some of the raindrops to evaporate which chills the air. The air now colder and heavier than the air around it begins to descend as a downdraft . The downdraft may be enhanced as falling precipitation drags some of the air along with it. The appearance of the downdraft marks the beginning of the mature stage. During its mature stage the thunderstorm is most intense. The top of the cloud having reached a stable region of the atmosphere (which may be the stratosphere) begins to take on the familiar anvil shape as upper-level winds spread the cloud's ice crystals horizontally.  Lightning and thunder are also present in the mature stage. After the storm enters the mature stage it begins to dissipate in about 15 to 30 minutes. The dissipating stage occurs when the updrafts weaken as the gust front moves away from the storm and no longer enhances the updrafts. At this stage downdrafts tend to dominate throughout much of the cloud. The reason the storm does not normally last very long is that the downdrafts inside the cloud tend to cut off the storm's fuel supply by destroying the humid updrafts. Deprived of the rich supply of warm humid air cloud droplets no longer form.,
693,How do downdrafts form in thunderstorms?,,As the cloud builds well above the freezing level the cloud particles grow larger and heavier as they collide and join with one another. Eventually the rising air is no longer able to keep them suspended and they begin to fall. While this phenomenon is taking place drier air from around the cloud is being drawn into it in a process called entrainment. The entrainment of drier air causes some of the raindrops to evaporate which chills the air. The air now colder and heavier than the air around it begins to descend as a downdraft . The downdraft may be enhanced as falling precipitation drags some of the air along with it. ,
694,Why do ordinary cell thunderstorms most frequently form in the afternoon?,,,
695,What is necessary for a multicell thunderstorm to form?,,Multicell storms tend to form in a region of moderate-to-strong vertical wind speed shear. The wind speed increases rapidly with height producing strong wind speed shear. This type of shearing causes the cell inside the storm to tilt in such a way that the updraft actually rides up and over the downdraft.,
696,Explain why ordinary cell thunderstorms tend to dissipate much sooner than multicell storms.,,The ordinary cell thunderstorm tends to have a vertical updraft so preciptiation falls back through the updraft.  The multicell storm has a tilted updraft that allows the updraft to continue as prcipitation will fall to the ground outside the updraft.,
697,How does the National Weather Service define a severe thunderstorm?,,,
698,What is a derecho and how does it form?,,When the damage associated with the straight-line winds extends for a considerable distance along the squall line's path the windstorm is called a derecho (day-ray-sho) after the Spanish word for 'straight ahead.' Typically derechoes form in the early evening and last throughout the night.,
699,Why is the term wind shear often used in conjunction with a microburst?,,The microburst will collide witht he ground and srpread away causing rapid changes in wind direction and speed with altitude.,
700,How does a squall line differ from a Mesoscale Convective Complex (MCC)?,,MCCs are large circular convective systems. Squall lines are linear features.,
701,Give a possible explanation for the generation of a pre-frontal squall-line thunderstorm.,,The surging nature of the main cold front itself or developing cumulus clouds along the front may cause the air aloft to develop into waves (called gravity waves) much like the waves that form downwind of a mountain chain. Out ahead of the cold front the rising motion of the wave may be the trigger that initiates the development of cumulus clouds and a pre-frontal squall line.,
702,Where are the strongest straight-line winds normally observed with a squall line?,,The strongest straight-line winds tend to form near the center of the bow-shaped squall line where the sharpest bending occurs.,
703,What is a bow echo and how does it appear on a radar screen?,,As strong winds associated with a squall line rush forward along the ground they sometimes push the squall line outward so that it appears as a bow (or a series of bows) on the radar screen. Such a bow-shaped squall line is called a bow echo.,
704,How does the cell in an ordinary cell thunderstorm differ from the cell in a supercell thunderstorm?,,The updraft in a supercell thunderstorm is longer-lasting and rotates.,
705,Describe the atmospheric conditions at the surface and aloft that are necessary for the development of most supercell thunderstorms. (Include in your answer the role that the lowlevel jet plays in the rotating updraft.),,In a region where there is strong vertical wind shear as might be caused with the existence of a low-level jet the thunderstorm may form in such a way that the outflow of cold air from the downdraft never undercuts the updraft. In such a storm the wind shear may be so strong as to create horizontal spin which when tilted into the updraft causes it to rotate. A large long-lasting thunderstorm with a single violently rotating updraft is called a supercell. It is the rotating aspect of the supercell that can lead to the formation of tornadoes.,
706,What is the difference between an HP supercell and an LP supercell?,,HP supercells (for High Precipitation) often produce extreme downdrafts (called downbursts) flash flooding and very large hail. If tornadoes are present it is often difficult to see them as they tend to form in the area of heavy precipitation. A supercell characterized by little precipitation is referred to as an LP supercell (for Low Precipitation).,
707,When thunderstorms are training what are they doing?,,When thunderstorms are training they keep passing over the same area like railroad cars one after another passing over the same tracks.,
708,In what region in the United States do dryline thunderstorms most frequently form? Why there?,,In western Texas Kansas and Oklahoma.,
709,Explain the following:,,,
712,Describe one process by which thunderstorms become electrified.,,One theory proposes that clouds become electrified when graupel (small ice particles called soft hail) and hailstones fall through a region of supercooled liquid droplets and ice crystals. As liquid droplets collide with a hailstone they freeze on contact and release latent heat. This process keeps the surface of the hailstone warmer than that of the surrounding ice crystals. When the warmer hailstone comes in contact with a colder ice crystal an important phenomenon occurs: There is a net transfer of positive ions (charged molecules) from the warmer object to the colder object. Hence the hailstone (larger warmer particle) becomes negatively charged and the ice crystal (smaller cooler particle) positively charged as the positive ions are incorporated into the ice crystal.,
713,Explain how a cloud-to-ground lightning stroke develops.,,<ol> 	<li>When the negative charge near the bottom of the cloud becomes large enough to overcome the air's resistance a flow of electrons - the stepped leader - rushes toward the earth.</li> 	<li>As the electrons approach the ground a region of positive charge moves up into the air through any conducting object such as trees buildings and even humans.</li> 	<li>When the downward flow of electrons meets the upward surge of positive charge a strong electric current - a bright return stroke - carries positive charge upward into the cloud.</li> </ol>,
714,Explain the following:,,,
715,Explain the following:,,,
716,How does negative cloud-to-ground lightning differ from positive cloud-to-ground lightning?,,The typical cloud-to-ground lightning flash is called negative cloud-to-ground-lightning because the stroke carries negative charges from the cloud to the ground.  About 90 percent of all cloud-to-ground lightning is negative.  However when the base of the cloud is positively charged and the ground negatively charged a positive cloud-to-ground lightning flash may result.  Positive lightning most common with severe thunderstorms has the potential to cause more damage because it generates a much higher current level and its flash lasts for a longer duration than negative lightning.,
717,How is thunder produced?,,Thunder is the sound that results from the rapidly expanding heated air along the channel of the lightning stroke,
718,Why is it unwise to seek shelter under an isolated tree during a thunderstorm? If caught out in the open what should you do?,,As the electrons approach the ground a region of positive charge moves up into the air through any conducting object such as trees buildings and even humans. Because a positive charge tends to concentrate in upward projecting objects such as trees the upward return stroke that meets the stepped leader is most likely to originate from such objects. Thus it is unsafe to stand near a tree during an electrical storm.,
719,Why do the majority of tornadoes move from southwest to northeast?,,Tornadoes are associated with supercell thunderstorms which are caused in part by strong divergence aloft.  Divergence tends to be strongest in the southwest flow ahead of an upper-air trough.,
720,What is the primary difference between a tornado and a funnel cloud?,,A funnel cloud is a tornado whose circulation has not reached the ground,
721,What is a tornado? Give some average statistics about tornado size winds and direction of movement.,,The diameter of most tornadoes is between 100 and 600 meters (about 300 to 2000 feet) although some are just a few meters wide and others have diameters exceeding 1600 meters (1 mile). They tend to move from the southwest toward the northeast at speeds usually between 20 and 40 knots.,
722,If you see a tornado and it appears to be stretched into the shape of a rope what stage of development is the tornado in?,,The final stage of a tornado's life cycle called the decay stage usually finds the tornado stretched into the shape of a rope. ,
723,Why is the Central Plains of the United States most susceptible to tornado development than any other region of the world?,,<ol> 	<li>Convective instability with moist warm air at the surface arriving from the Gulf of Mexico overlain with cold dry air arriving from the Rocky Mountains.</li> 	<li>Wind shear between air flowing fron the southeast in the surface layer and winds from the southwest aloft potentially aided by the presence of a low-level jet.</li> 	<li>A trigger mechanism often in the form of a dry line or cold front.</li> </ol>,
724,Is it more likely for a tornado to have a rotating wind speed of 125 mi/hr or 200 mi/hr?,,Even the most powerful twisters seldom have winds exceeding 250 miles/hour and most tornadoes have winds of less than 135 miles/hour.,
725,What is 'tornado alley' and where is it located?,,In the Oklahoma Kansas area.,
726,During what months are tornadoes most frequent in the United States?,,About 70 percent of all tornadoes in the United States develop from March to July.,
727,Explain both how and why there is a shift in tornado activity from winter to summer.,,During the winter tornadoes are most likely to form over the southern Gulf states when the polar-front jet is above this region and the contrast between warm and cold air masses is greatest. In spring humid Gulf air surges northward; contrasting air masses and the jet stream also moves northward and tornadoes become more prevalent from the southern Atlantic states westward into the southern Great Plains. In summer the contrast between air masses lessens and the jet stream is normally near the Canadian border; hence tornado activity tends to be concentrated from the northern plains eastward to New York state.,
728,Why should you not open windows when a tornado is approaching?,,It appears that opening windows during a tornado actually increases the pressure on the opposite wall and increases the chances that the building will collapse. Also windows are usually shattered by flying debris and it is wise to stay away from them.,
729,Tornadoes most frequently occur during what hours of the day?,,Although tornadoes have occurred at all times of the day and night they are most frequent in the late afternoon (between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.) when the surface air is most unstable; they are least frequent in the early morning before sunrise when the atmosphere is most stable.,
730,If a tornado is moving toward the northeast on which side of the tornado (northwest or southeast) would the winds be strongest?,,Southeast.,
731,Explain how suction vortices can add wind speed to a large multi-vortex tornado.,,The surging nature of the main cold front itself or developing cumulus clouds along the front.,
732,Explain how a violent multivortex tornado will completely demolish some homes in its path and yet leave others standing.,,If a tornado is moving northeast at a speed of 50 miles/hour and its rotating winds are 100 miles/hour then the wind speed on the tornado's southeast side would be 150 miles/hour. If a suction vortex is spinning at 50 miles/hour and located in the large tornado's southeastern side then the total wind speed for the tornado on this side would be 50 + 100 + 50 or 200 miles/hour. This situation where stronger winds exist at different regions within a large violent multi-vortex tornado explains why some homes in the tornado's path are completely obliterated while others sustain considerable damage but are left standing.,
733,How does a tornado watch differ from a tornado warning?,,When tornadoes are likely to form during the next few hours a tornado watch is issued to alert the public that tornadoes may develop within a specific area during a certain time period. Once a tornado is spotted  -  either visually or on a radar screen  -  a tornado warning is issued.,
734,If you are in a single story house (without a basement) during a tornado warning what should you do?,,The safest place is usually in a small room such as a bathroom closet or interior hallway near the middle of the building.,
735,If you are in a mobile home during a tornado warning what should you do?,,Leave immediately and seek substantial shelter. If none exists lie flat on the ground in a depression or ravine. ,
736,Give two reasons for the possible increase in the average number of tornadoes reported in the United States during the past six decades.,,This increase may be due to the fact that more people now live in areas where tornadoes are prevalent; hence many tornadoes that would have gone undetected in years past are now reported. Another reason for the tornado increase may be due to the improvements in radar technology that makes identifying a tornado easier today than in the past.,
737,How does the new enhanced Fujita scale differ from the old Fujita scale? Why was the old Fujita scale modified?,,The original Fujita scale implemented in 1971 was based mainly on tornado damage incurred by a frame house. Because there are many types of structures susceptible to tornado damage a new scale came into effect in February 2007. Called the Enhanced Fujita Scale or simply the EF Scale the new scale attempts to provide a wide range of criteria in estimating a tornado's winds by using a set of 28 damage indicators. These indicators include items such as small barns mobile homes schools and trees. Each item is then examined for the degree of damage it sustained. The combination of the damage indicators along with the degree of damage provides a range of probable wind speeds and an EF rating for the tornado.,
738,Is it unusual or common to have three EF5 tornadoes in a year?,,Only a few percent of tornadoes each year are classified as violent with perhaps one or two EF5 tornadoes reported annually (although several years may pass without the United States experiencing an EF5).,
739,Explain why 'tornado families' are often so deadly.,,The deadliest tornadoes are those that occur in families; that is different tornadoes spawned by the same thunderstorm. (Some thunderstorms produce a sequence of several tornadoes over two or more hours and over distances of 50 miles or more.) Tornado families oft en are the result of a single long-lived supercell thunderstorm. When a large number of tornadoes (typically six or more) form over a particular region this constitutes what is termed a tornado outbreak.,
740,Give an explanation as to how a supercell thunderstorm can develop a rotating updraft.,,Wind shear causes the air near the surface to rotate about a horizontal axis much like a pencil rotates around its long axis. Such horizontal tubes of spinning air are called vortex tubes. These vortex tubes also form when a southerly low-level jet exists just above southerly surface winds. If the strong updraft of a developing thunderstorm should tilt the rotating tube upward and draw it into the storm the tilted rotating tube then becomes a rotating air column inside the storm.,
741,Supercell thunderstorms that produce tornadoes form in a region of strong wind shear. Explain how the wind usually changes in speed and direction to produce this shear.,,Rapidly increasing wind speed with height provides vertical wind speed shear and the changing wind direction with height - from southerly at low levels to westerly at high levels - provides wind direction shear which induces the updrafts inside the storms to rotate.,
742,What atmospheric conditions are necessary for the formation of supercells that spawn tornadoes.,,Convective instability with moist warm air at the surface overlain with cold dry air.,
743,If you are looking up and see rotating clouds associated with a supercell above you would the clouds (as you view them) most likely be rotating clockwise or counterclockwise? (This question is a bit tricky so it may be helpful to make a sketch on a piece of paper.),,Clockwise.,
744,Are gustnadoes classified as supercell or nonsupercell tornadoes? Why?,,Non-supercell tornadoes that form along a gust front are commonly called gustnadoes.  These relatively weak tornadoes normally are short-lived and rarely inflict significant damage.,
745,How has Doppler radar helped in the prediction of severe weather and tornadoes?,,The NEXRAD network of Doppler radar units deployed at selected weather stations within the continental United States take in data display it on monitors and run computer programs called algorithms which in conjunction with other meteorological data detect severe weather phenomena such as storm cells hail mesocyclones and tornadoes. The algorithms provide a great deal of information to the forecasters that allows them to make better decisions as to which thunderstorms are most likely to produce severe weather and possible flash flooding. In addition they give advanced and improved warning of an approaching tornado.,
746,What atmospheric conditions lead to the formation of 'fair weather' waterspouts?,,Fair weather waterspouts tend to form in much the same way that landspouts do - when the air is conditionally unstable and cumulus clouds are developing. Some form with small thunderstorms but most form with developing cumulus congestus clouds whose tops are frequently no higher than 3600 meters (12000 feet) and do not extend to the freezing level. Apparently the warm humid air near the water helps to create atmospheric instability and the updraft beneath the resulting cloud helps initiate uplift of the surface air.,
747,Describe how Doppler radar measures the winds inside a severe thunderstorm.,,A radar transmitter sends out microwave pulses that are scattered back to the antenna when the microwave energy strikes an object. Precipitation particles are large enough to bounce microwaves back to the antenna. Doppler radar works on the principle that as precipitation moves toward or away from the antenna the returning radar pulse will change in frequency. This change in frequency is called the Doppler shift and is used to distinguish the storm's air motions.,
748,Explain how a nonsupercell tornado such as a landspout might form.,,When surface winds converge along a boundary of topographic irregularities the rising air begins to spin due to fact that the winds are blowing from different (opposite directions). As the spinning rising air shrinks in diameter it produces a landspout a tornado-like structure.,
749,What is a tropical (easterly) wave? How do these waves generally move in the Northern Hemisphere? Are showers found on the eastern or western side of the wave?,,Tropical waves are disturbances in the trade winds wherein air is diverted to the north and then back again creating a 'wave' in airflow. Tropical waves have wavelengths on the order of 2500 km (1550 mi) and travel from east to west at speeds between 10 and 20 knots.  On the western side of the trough where easterly and northeasterly surface winds diverge sinking air produces generally fair weather. On its eastern side southeasterly surface winds converge. The converging air rises cools and often condenses into showers and thunderstorms. Consequently the main area of showers forms behind the trough. Occasionally a tropical wave will intensify and grow into a hurricane.,
750,Why are streamlines rather than isobars used on surface weather maps in the tropics?,,Streamlines are useful because they show where surface air converges and diverges.,
751,What is the name given to a hurricane-like storm that forms over the western North Pacific Ocean?,,Typhoon.,
752,Describe the horizontal and vertical structure of a hurricane.,,In a hurricane clouds align themselves into spiraling bands (called spiral rain bands) that swirl in toward the storm's center where they wrap themselves around the eye. Surface winds increase in speed as they blow counterclockwise and inward toward this center. (In the Southern Hemisphere the winds blow clockwise around the center.) Adjacent to the eye is the eyewall a ring of intense thunderstorms that whirl around the storm's center and may extend upward to almost 18 km (59000 ft) above sea level. Within the eyewall we find the heaviest precipitation and the strongest winds.,
753,List three 'triggers' that help in the initial stage of hurricane development.,,1. Convergence of air along the ITCZ  2. An easterly wave  3. Pre-exiting atmospheric disturbance (remnant front),
754,Why are skies oft en clear or partly cloudy in a hurricane's eye?,,Near the surface of a hurricane moist tropical air flows in toward the hurricane's center. Adjacent to the eye this air rises and condenses into huge cumulonimbus clouds that produce heavy rainfall. Near the top of the clouds the relatively dry air having lost much of its moisture begins to flow outward away from the center. This diverging air aloft actually produces a clockwise (anticyclonic in the Northern Hemisphere) flow of air several hundred kilometers from the eye. As this outflow reaches the storm's periphery it begins to sink and warm inducing clear skies. In the vigorous convective clouds of the eyewall the air warms due to the release of large quantities of latent heat. This warming produces slightly higher pressures aloft which initiate downward air motion within the eye. As the air sinks it warms by compression. This process helps to account for the warm air and the absence of thunderstorms in the center of the storm.,
755,What conditions at the surface and aloft are necessary for hurricane development?,,Hurricanes form over tropical waters where the winds are light the humidity is high in a deep layer extending up through the troposphere and the surface water temperature is warm typically 26.5 degrees C (80 degrees F) or greater over a vast area.      For a mass of unorganized thunderstorms to develop into a hurricane the surface winds must converge. In the Northern Hemisphere converging air spins counterclockwise about an area of surface low pressure. Rotation will not develop on the equator where the Coriolis force is zero hurricanes form in tropical regions usually between 5 degrees  and 20 degrees  latitude.,
756,The Fujita scale pertains to:,1. the size of a tornado producing thunderstorm 2. the amount of hail that falls from a mature thunderstorm 3. the size of the thunderstorm image on a radar screen 4. the strength of a tornado ,4. the strength of a tornado,
757,Most waterspouts would fall into which category of the Fujita scale?,1. F0 2. F1 3. F2 4. F4 or F5 ,1. F0,
758,About two-thirds of all tornadoes fall into which of the following categories on the Fujita scale?,1. F0 or F1 2. F2 or F3 3. F0 or F5 4. F4 or F5 ,1. F0 or F1,
759,All thunderstorms require:,"1. hot, humid air 2. divergence of the air aloft 3. lifting along some barrier such as a mountain or front 4. surface heating 5. rising air ",5. rising air,
760,Most waterspouts:,1. form in severe thunderstorms 2. draw water up into their core 3. have rotating winds of less than 45 knots 4. form in an area where winds are descending from a cloud 5. actually form over land ,3. have rotating winds of less than 45 knots,
761,Streamlines on a weather map depict:,1. water temperature 2. pressure 3. wind flow 4. dew point 5. ocean currents ,3. wind flow,
762,What determines the maximum strength (the highest winds) that the storm can achieve?,,The amount of water vapor available to be condensed into cloud drops which is a function of the temperature of the ocean beneath.,
763,Hurricanes are sometimes described as a heat engine. What is the 'fuel' that drives the hurricane?,,Water vapor.  The energy used to evaporate water is transformed into  heat during condensation into clouds.,
764,If a hurricane with sustained winds of 100 mi/hr is moving westward at 20 mi/hr will the strongest winds and greatest damage potential be on its northern or southern side? Explain. If the same hurricane turns northward will the strongest winds and greatest damage potential be on its eastern or western side?,,Northern side.  With the storm moving westward the north sid gets the combination of hurricane motion plus the speed of the winds blowing onshore on the north side.  On the south side winds will be off shore and slowed by friction and in a direction opposite storm motion.,
765,What factors tend to weaken hurricanes?,,Wind shear passage over cooler or shallower water increased ocean wave activity passage over land.,
766,Would it be possible for a hurricane to form over land? Explain.,,No.  The lack of water vapor to generate heat plus the added friction of the land surface (trees buildings etc.) cause winds to be less organized.,
767,Distinguish among a tropical depression a tropical storm and a hurricane.,,Initially the mass of thunderstorms with only a slight wind circulation is known as a tropical disturbance or tropical wave. The tropical disturbance becomes a tropical depression when the winds increase to between 20 and 34 knots and several closed isobars appear about its center on a surface weather map. When the isobars are packed together and the winds are between 35 and 64 knots the tropical depression becomes a tropical storm. The tropical storm is classified as a hurricane only when its winds exceed 64 knots (74 miles/hour).,
768,In what ways is a hurricane different from a mid-latitude cyclone? In what ways are these two systems similar?,,Similarities: both have central cores of low pressure and winds that spiral counterclockwise about their respective centers (Northern Hemisphere). Differences: a hurricane derives its energy from the warm water and the latent heat of condensation whereas the mid-latitude storm derives its energy from horizontal temperature contrasts. The vertical structure of a hurricane is such that its central column of air is warm from the surface upward; consequently hurricanes are called warmcore lows. A hurricane weakens with height and the area of low pressure at the surface may actually become an area of high pressure above 12 kilometers (40000 feet). Mid-latitude cyclones on the other hand are cold-core lows that usually intensify with increasing height with a cold upper-level low or trough often existing above or to the west of the surface low. A hurricane usually contains an eye where the air is sinking while mid-latitude cyclones are characterized by centers of rising air. Hurricane winds are strongest near the surface whereas the strongest winds of the mid-latitude storm are found aloft in the jet stream.,
769,Explain how a storm surge forms. How does it inflict damage in hurricane-prone areas?,,The combined effect of high water (which is usually well above the high-tide level) high winds and the net Ekman transport toward the coast produces the storm surge - an abnormal rise of several meters in the ocean level - which inundates low-lying areas and turns beachfront homes into piles of splinters. The storm surge is particularly damaging when it coincides with normal high tides.,
770,Why do most hurricanes move westward over tropical waters?,,The form between the equator and 30 degrees  latitude in the trade winds which generally blow from the east.,
771,When Hurricane Andrew moved over south Florida during August 1992 what was it that apparently caused the relatively small areas of extreme damage?,,Spin-up vortices (mini-swirls).,
772,As Hurricane Katrina moved toward the Louisiana coast it underwent eyewall replacement. What actually happened to the eyewall during this process?,,Katrina's rainbands near the center of the storm converged cutting off moisture to the eyewall and causing it to dissipate. A new one formed farther away.,
773,Hurricanes are given names when the storm is in what stage of development?,,The name is assigned when the storm reaches tropical storm strength.,
774,How do meteorologists forecast the intensity and paths of hurricanes?,,Information from satellites buoys and data collected by reconnaissance aircraft are fed into computer models which forecast the movement and intensity of the storm.,
775,How does a hurricane watch differ from a hurricane warning?,,When a hurricane poses a direct threat to an area a hurricane watch is issued. When it appears that the storm will strike an area within 24 hours a hurricane warning is issued.,
776,Why have hurricanes been seeded with silver iodide?,,In attempts to reduce their winds.,
777,Give two reasons why hurricanes are more likely to strike New Jersey than Oregon.,,Sea surface temperatures offshore of New Jersey are warmer than those offshore of Oregon. Also a typical path of Atlantic hurricanes passes westward across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean Sea then turns northward along the eastern shore of North America passing close to New Jersey. Typical paths of Pacific hurricanes pass nowhere near Oregon.,
778,What is the function of the National Center for Environmental Prediction?,,The National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) receives global weather data from several world meteorological centers many times each day. The data is analyzed and plotted and forecasts are prepared and transmitted to National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).,
779,How does a weather watch differ from a weather warning?,,A watch indicates that atmospheric conditions favor hazardous weather occurring over a particular region during a specified time period. A warning on the other hand indicates that hazardous weather is either imminent or actually occurring within the specified forecast area. Advisories are issued to inform the public of less hazardous conditions caused by wind dust fog snow sleet or freezing rain.,
780,List some of the tools a weather forecaster might use when making a short-range forecast.,,Soundings satellite imagery Doppler radar surface weather maps upper-air winds and pattern recognition computer-drawn progs and statistical information such as Model Output Statistics (MOS).,
781,In what ways has the computer assisted the meteorologist in making weather forecasts?,,The initial chart in the numerical weather prediction process is referred to as an analysis. The analysis represents current conditions which are used to make a prediction about the future condition of the atmosphere. The final forecast chart representing the atmosphere at a specified future time is called a prognostic chart or simply a prog.,
782,How does a prog differ from an analysis?,,Modern electronic computers can analyze large quantities of data extremely fast. Each day the many thousands of observations transmitted to NCEP are fed into a high-speed computer which plots and draws lines on surface and upper-air charts. Meteorologists interpret the weather patterns and then correct any errors that may be present. The routine daily forecasting of weather by the computer has come to be known as numerical weather prediction. To help forecasters handle all the available charts and maps high-speed data modeling systems using computers are employed. The communication system in use today is known as AWIPS (Advanced Weather Interactive ProcessingSystem).,
783,How are computer-generated weather forecasts prepared?,,The models are programmed into the computer and surface and upper-air observations of temperature pressure moisture winds and air density are fed into the equations. To determine how each of these variables will change each equation is solved for a small increment of future time say five minutes for a large number of locations called grid points each situated a given distance apart. In addition each equation is solved for as many as 50 levels in the atmosphere. The results of these computations are then fed back into the original equations. The computer again solves the equations with the new 'data' thus predicting weather over the following five minutes. This procedure is done repeatedly until it reaches some desired time in the future usually 12 24 36 or 48 hours. The computer then analyzes the data and draws the projected positions of pressure systems with their isobars or contour lines.,
784,What are some of the problems associated with computer-model forecasts?,,The sparsity of observations over uninhabited regions of the earth errors related to weather systems crossing the boundaries of model domains difficulty in forecasting small-scale weather features inadequate characterization of interactions of water ice surface friction and local terrain large sensitivities to initial imperfections (chaos).,
785,Make a persistence forecast for your area for this same time tomorrow. Did you use any skill in making this prediction? Explain.,,,
786,Describe four methods of forecasting the weather and give an example for each one.,,Persistence: a prediction that future weather will be the same as present weather. If it is snowing today a persistence forecast would call for snow through tomorrow.  Steady-state (trend) method: the principle involved here is that surface weather systems tend to move in the same direction and at approximately the same speed as they have been moving providing no evidence exists to indicate otherwise. Suppose for example that a cold front is moving eastward at an average speed of 30 kilometers per hour and it is 90 kilometers west of your home. Using the steady-state method we might extrapolate and predict that the front should pass through your area in three hours.  Analogue method: this method relies on the fact that existing features on a weather chart (or a series of charts) may strongly resemble features that produced certain weather conditions sometime in the past. A forecaster might look at a prog and say 'I've seen this weather situation before and this happened.' Prior weather events can then be utilized as a guide to the future.  Statistical methods: known as Model Output Statistics or MOS these predictions in effect are statistically weighted analogue forecast corrections incorporated into the computer model output. For example a forecast of tomorrow's maximicron temperature might be derived from a statistical equation that uses a numerical model's forecast of relative humidity cloud cover wind direction and air temperature.,
787,How does pattern recognition aid a forecaster in making a prediction?,,A forecaster might look at a prog and say 'I've seen this weather situation before and this happened.' Prior weather events can then be utilized as a guide to the future. The problem here is that even though weather situations may appear similar they are never exactly the same. There are always sufficient differences in the variables to make applying this method a challenge.,
788,How can ensemble forecasts improve medium-range weather forecasts?,,Ensemble forecasting is a technique based on running several forecast models (or different versions of a single model) each beginning with slightly different weather information to reflect errors in the measurements. If the different versions agree fairly well a forecaster can place a high degree of confidence in the forecast. A low degree of confidence means that the models do not agree.,
789,Do all accurate forecasts show skill? Explain.,,Forecasts show skill when they are more accurate than a forecast utilizing only persistence or climatology.,
790,How can a sounding help in the prediction of severe weather and especially severe thunderstorms?,,relatively small area such as the mesoscale. The forecaster examines the sounding of the immediate area (or closest proximity) as well as the soundings of those sites upwind to see how the atmosphere might be changing. Computer programs then automatically calculate from the sounding a number of meteorological indexes that can aid the forecaster in determining the likelihood of smaller-scale weather phenomena such as thunderstorms tornadoes and hail. Soundings also provide information that can aid in the prediction of fog air pollution alerts and the downwind mixing of strong winds.,
791,Do monthly and seasonal forecasts make specific predictions of rain or snow? Explain.,,No. These forecasts called outlooks predict average weather conditions for a particular month or a season. These are not forecasts in the strict sense but rather an overview of how average precipitation and temperature patterns may compare with normal conditions.,
792,If the value of CAPE derived from a sounding over Atlanta Georgia is 3600 J/Kg would you expect a forecast for Atlanta to be 'fair and warmer?' Explain.,,No.  A CAPE value of 3600 J/kg indicates extremely unstable conditions with very strong convection.  Severe thunderstorms would be possible.,
793,What atmospheric conditions cause the forecaster to issue a severe thunderstorm watch? What would be necessary for the same forecaster to issue a tornado warning?,,Severe thunderstorm watch: CAPE values of 2500-3500. Tornado warning: a tornado has been spotted either visually or by Doppler radar.,
794,How does the thickness chart aid a forecaster in predicting whether falling precipitation will be in the form of rain or snow?,,One forecasting rule is that the 5400-meter thickness line often represents the dividing line between rain and snow especially for cities receiving precipitation east of the Rocky Mountains. If precipitation is falling cities with a thickness greater than 5400 meters should be receiving rain whereas cities with a thickness less than 5400 meters should be receiving snow.,
795,Explain how teleconnections can be used in making a long-range weather forecast.,,Using information about weather interactions in different regions of the world the Climate Prediction Center can issue a seasonal outlook of an impending wetter or drier winter months in advance. Forecasts using teleconnections have shown promise. For example as the tropical equatorial Pacific became much warmer than normal during the spring and early summer of 1997 forecasters predicted a wet rainfall season over central and southern California.,
796,What are the conditions over the tropical eastern and central Pacific Ocean during the phenomenon known as El Nino? La Nina?,,Under ordinary conditions higher pressure over the southeastern Pacific and lower pressure near Indonesia produces easterly trade winds along the equator. These winds promote upwelling and cooler ocean water in the eastern Pacific while warmer water prevails in the western Pacific. The trades are part of a circulation (called the Walker circulation) that typically finds rising air and heavy rain over the western Pacific and sinking air and generally dry weather over the eastern Pacific. When the trades are exceptionally strong water along the equator in the eastern Pacific becomes quite cool. This cool event is called La Nina. During El Nino conditions atmospheric pressure decreases over the eastern Pacific and rises over the western Pacific. This change in pressure causes the trades to weaken or reverse direction. This situation enhances the countercurrent that carries warm water from the west over a vast region of the eastern tropical Pacific. The thermocline which separates the warm water of the upper ocean from the cold water below changes as the ocean conditions change from non-El Nino to El Nino.,
797,Describe the ocean surface temperatures associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. What climate patterns (cool/ warm wet/dry) tend to exist during the warm phase and the cool phase?,,During the warm (or positive) phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation unusually warm surface water exists along the west coast of North America whereas over the central North Pacific cooler than normal surface water prevails. At the same time the Aleutian low in the Gulf of Alaska strengthens which causes more Pacific storms to move into Alaska and California. This situation causes winters as a whole to be warmer and drier over northwestern North America. Elsewhere winters tend to be drier over the Great Lakes and cooler and wetter in the southern United States.,
798,What type of weather (cold/ warm wet/dry) would you expect over North America during a strong El Nino? During a strong La Nina?,,Such a large area of abnormally warm water can have an effect on global wind patterns. The warm tropical water fuels the atmosphere with additional warmth and moisture which the atmosphere turns into additional storminess and rainfall. The added warmth from the oceans and the release of latent heat during condensation apparently influence the westerly winds aloft in such a way that certain regions of the world experience too much rainfall and flooding whereas others have too little and experience drought. Meanwhile over the warm tropical central Pacific the frequency of typhoons usually increases. However over the tropical Atlantic between Africa and Central America strong winds aloft tend to disrupt the organization of thunderstorms that is necessary for hurricane development; hence there are fewer hurricanes in this region during strong El Nino events. During strong El Nino events there is a tendency for monsoon conditions over India to weaken.,
799,How does the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation differ from the negative phase?,,During the positive phase of the NAO winters in the eastern United States tend to be wet and relatively mild while northern Canada and Greenland are usually cold and dry. The negative phase of the NAO occurs when the atmospheric pressure in the vicinity of the Icelandic low rises while the pressure drops in the region of the Bermuda high (see Fig. 14.20b). This pressure change results in a reduced pressure gradient and weaker westerlies that steer fewer and weaker winter storms across the Atlantic in a more westerly path. These storms bring wet weather to southern Europe and to the region around the Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile winters in Northern Europe are usually cold and dry as are the winters along the east coast of North America. Greenland and northern Canada usually experience mild winters.,
800,What methods do scientists use to determine climate conditions that have occurred in the past?,,The study of the geological evidence left behind by advancing and retreating glaciers; collection of fossil pollen of tundra plants; core samples taken from ocean floor sediments and Greenland and Antarctica ice; the study of annual growth rings of trees; documents concerning droughts floods and crop yields; the study of oxygen-isotope ratios of corals; borehole temperature profiles.,
801,During the negative cold phase of the Arctic Oscillation when Greenland is experiencing mild winters what type of winters (cold or mild) is northern Europe usually experiencing?,,Colder than usual.,
802,Explain how the changing climate influenced the formation of the Bering land bridge.,,The most recent North American glaciers reached their maximicron thickness and extent about 18000 to 22000 years ago. At that time the sea level was perhaps 120 meters (395 feet) lower than it is now. The lower sea level exposed vast areas of land such as the Bering land bridge a strip of land that connected Siberia to Alaska which allowed human and animal migration from Asia to North America.,
803,What is the Younger Dryas episode? When did it occur?,,As tempratures rose about 14000 y.a. due to changing orbital conditions the continental ice sheet over North America began to melt back. Then about 12700 y.a. the average temperature suddenly dropped and northeastern North America and northern Europe reverted back to glacial conditions. About 1000 years later the cold spell (known as the Younger Dryas*) ended abruptly. ,
804,What are some of the possible causes for the Little Ice Age?,,,
805,How does today's average global temperature compare with the average temperature during most of the past 1000 years?,,The global temperature appears to be a fraction of a degree higher than it has been in the past.,
806,Explain how the ocean conveyor belt plays a role in the climate of northern Europe.,,Westerly winds blowing across the Atlantic evaporate the warmish waters arriving from the Gulf Stream.  As the water evaporates it leaves behind salt making the water more saline and heavier.  This heavier water slowly sinks and takes with it whatever gases have been absorbed at the surface.  The warmth and moisture resulting from this process keeps Europe warmer than at the same latitudes in North America.,
807,Describe how the earth's average surface temperature has changed since the early 1900s.,,In the early 1900s the average global surface temperature began to rise. From about 1900 to 1945 the average temperature rose nearly 0.5 degrees C. Following the warmer period the earth began to cool slightly over the next 25 years or so. In the late 1960s and 1970s the cooling trend ended over most of the Northern Hemisphere. In the mid-1970s a warming trend set in that continued into the twenty-first century. In fact over the Northern Hemisphere the decade of the 1990s was the warmest of the 20th century with 1998 and 2005 being the warmest years in over 1000 years.,
808,List some of the natural causes of climate change.,,1. Orbital fluctuations 2. Solar fluctuations 3. Volcanic activity  4. Plate techtonics,
809,How does a positive feedback mechanism differ from a negative feedback mechanism? Is the water vapor-greenhouse feedback considered positive or negative? Explain.,,If a perturbation to a system (like climate) causes that perturbation to amplify it is a positive feedback.  As temerpatures rise it could lead to more water vapor in the atmosphere which in turn is a greenhouse gas.  In this respect it is a  positive feedback.  If on the other hand the water vapor produces more thibk clouds this could block out sunlight and be a negative feedback mechanism.  Current thinking is water vapor is more a positive feedback than negative.,
810,Describe the Milankovitch theory of climatic change by explaining how each of the three cycles alters the amount of solar energy reaching the earth.,,The Milankovitch theory of climatic changeacknowledges that the earth's orbit changes in three ways over time:  1. The orbit moves from roughly circular to elliptical.  An elliptical orbit harvests less sunlight over the year.  2. The tilt of the eart wobbles pointing now toward the North Star it will point elsewhere over time changing the time of year that the earth is closest the sun.  3. The tilt of the earth varies from 21.5 degrees  to 24.5 degrees  thus changing the degree of seasonality.,
811,How does the theory of plate tectonics explain climate change over periods of millions of years?,,According to plate tectonics the now existing continents were at one time joined together in a single huge continent which broke apart. Its pieces slowly moved across the face of the earth thus changing the distribution of continents and ocean basins. We find glacial features near sea level in Africa today suggesting that the area underwent a period of glaciation hundreds of millions of years ago. Were temperatures at low elevations near the equator ever cold enough to produce ice sheets? Probably not. The ice sheets formed when this land mass was located at a much higher latitude. Over the many millions of years since then the land has slowly moved to its present position. Along the same line we can see how the fossil remains of tropical vegetation can be found under layers of ice in polar regions today.,
812,Given the analysis of air bubbles trapped in polar ice during the past 400000 years were CO2 levels generally higher or lower during colder glacial periods?,,During glacial periods CO2 levels were generally lower.  During glacial periods ocean water lowered as water evaporated and was deposited on land as snow.  The exposed land led to increased loads of nutrients into the ocean which caused biological growth and the systematic removal of CO2 leading to a positive feedback and further lowering of temperatures.,
813,In climate change what is a 'forcing factor?',,An external cause.,
814,How do the concentrations of CO2 in today's atmosphere compare with maximum CO2 levels thousands of years ago?,,CO2 levels today are the highest they've been in the past 10000 years. However they were just as high or higher 150000 250000 and 350000 years ago.,
815,How do sulfate aerosols in the lower atmosphere affect surface air temperatures during the day?,,Sulfate aerosols are of a size (~1 micron) that is efficient in scattering light.  Hence the sulfate reflects sunlight and generally leads to cooling.,
816,Describe the scenario of nuclear winter.,,A nuclear war would raise an enormous pall of thick sooty smoke from massive fires that would burn for days even weeks following an attack. The smoke would drift higher into the atmosphere where it would be caught in the upperlevel westerlies and circle the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For several weeks after the war sunlight would virtually be unable to penetrate the smoke layer bringing darkness or at best twilight at midday. Such reduction in solar energy would cause surface air temperatures over landmasses to drop below freezing even during the summer resulting in extensive damage to plants and crops and the death of millions (or perhaps billions) of people. The dark cold and gloomy conditions that would be brought on by nuclear war are often referred to as nuclear winter. As the lower troposphere cools the solar energy absorbed by the smoke particles in the upper troposphere would cause this region to warm. The end result would be a strong stable temperature inversion extending from the surface up into the higher atmosphere.,
817,Do volcanic eruptions rich in sulfur tend to warm or cool the earth's surface? Explain.,,Plumes from volcanoes can reach the stratosphere where the emitted sulfur dioxide (SO2) is chemically transformed into the aerosol sulfate (SO4).  These aerosols are of a size (~1micron) that is efficient at scattering sunlight hence increasing the earth's albedo.,
818,Explain how variations in the sun's energy output might influence global climate.,,Very little.  Fluctuations in solar output may account for small climatic changes over time scales of decades and centuries. Many theories have been proposed linking solar variations to climate change but none has been proven. However instruments aboard satellites and solar telescopes on the earth are monitoring the sun to observe how its energy output may vary. To date these measurements show that solar output has only changed a fraction of one percent over several decades.,
819,List several ways in which human activities can cause climate change.,,We are modifying the chemistry and characteristics of the atmosphere by injecting vast quantities of particles and greenhouse gases into the air. The human-induced sources include emissions from factories autos trucks aircraft  power plants home furnaces and fireplaces to name a few. Many aerosols are not injected directly into the atmosphere but form when gases convert to particles. Some particles such as sulfates and nitrates mainly reflect incoming sunlight whereas others such as soot readily absorb sunlight. Many of the particles that reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface tend to cause a net cooling of the surface air during the day. Sulfate aerosols not only reflect incoming sunlight back to space but they also serve as cloud condensation nuclei tiny particles on which cloud droplets form. Consequently they have the potential for altering the physical characteristics of clouds. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that strongly absorbs infrared radiation and plays a major role in the warming of the lower atmosphere. ,
820,Climate models predict that increasing levels of CO2 will cause the mean global surface air temperature to rise significantly by the year 2100. What other greenhouse gas must also increase in concentration in order for this condition to occur?,,Water vapor.,
821,Describe some of the natural and human-produced radiative forcing agents and their effect on climate.,,Water vapor via the water vapor-greenhouse effect feedback; solar irradiance changes; volcanic eruptions rich in sulfur.,
822,Explain the following:,,,
825,In Fig. 15.17 p. 449 explain why the actual rise in surface air temperature (gray line) is much less than the projected rise in air temperature due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases (yellow line).,,The yellow line represents projected temperature increases due to the effects of greenhouse gases alone ignoring the effects of aerosols and changes in solar radiation. The grey line (actual temperatures) responds to all of these processes.,
826,List some of the consequences that global warming might have on the atmosphere and its inhabitants.,,Climate models predict that land areas will warm more rapidly than the global average particularly in the northern high latitudes in winter. If warming allows the boreal forests to expand into the tundra the forests may accelerate the warming in that region. As the temperature rises organic matter in the soil should decompose at a faster rate adding more CO2 to the air which might accelerate the warming even more. In a warmer world enhanced evaporation of water should lead to greater worldwide average precipitation. Some models predict that the jet stream will weaken and global winds will shift from their 'normal' position. The shifting upper-level winds might reduce precipitation over certain areas which in turn would put added stress on certain agricultural regions.,
827,Why do climate scientists now believe that most of the warming experienced during the last 50 years was due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases and not natural causes?,,Because evidence from climate models and past temperature histories support the idea that the recent warming is largely due to greenhouse gases.,
828,Explain how global warming might influence the intensity and/or frequency of several extreme weather events.,,It is likely that in the future there will be more summer heat waves with more record high temperatures.  Recent modeling studies indicate that there will be an increased risk of more extreme more frequent and longer-lasting heat waves.  The added water vapor in the air brings a risk of more intense precipitation events.  In areas where precipitation is likely to decrease more frequent and extreme drought is likely.,
829,Hurricanes do not form:,1. along the ITCZ 2. along the equator 3. with an easterly wave 4. when the trade wind inversion is weak 5. when the surface water temperature exceeds 25¬∞C ,2. along the equator,
830,The surface pressure at the center of hurricane Gilbert decreased to a value of ____ the record minimum value for Atlantic hurricanes.,1. 953 mb 2. 888 mb 3. 734 mb 4. 238 mb ,2. 888 mb,
831,Describe how the area where hurricanes tend to form and the paths they tend to take along the east coast of the United States changes from August to October.,,During August hurricanes are most likely to form over the western tropical Atlantic where they then either track westward into the Gulf of Mexico toward Texas or they move northwestward into Florida or they follow a path parallel to the coast of the United States.  In September the region where hurricanes are most likely to form stretches westward into the Gulf of Mexico and northward along the Atlantic seaboard.  Typical hurricane paths take them into the central Gulf of Mexico for northeastward out over the Atlantic.  Should an Atlantic hurricane track close to the coastline it could make landfall anywhere from Florida to the mid-Atlantic states.  In October hurricanes are most likely to form in the western Caribbean and adjacent to the coast of North America where they tend to take a more northerly trajectory.,
832,If the high winds of a hurricane are not responsible for inflicting the most damage what is?,,The huge waves and flooding associated with the storm surge usually cause the most destruction.,
833,Most hurricane-related deaths are due to what?,,The majority of hurricane-related deaths during the past century has been due to flooding. The flooding is due in part to winds pushing water onto the shore and to the heavy rains. Flooding is also aided by the low pressure of the storm. The region of low pressure allows the ocean level to rise (perhaps half a meter) much like a soft drink rises up a straw as air is withdrawn. The combined effect of high water and high winds produces 'storm surge' - an abnormal rise of several meters in the ocean level.,
834,What atmospheric conditions would the forecaster look for when predicting: ,,,
