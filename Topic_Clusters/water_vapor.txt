289cd3a5-1534-4679-a189-7e10e702d20c,you said, "to get the relative humidity, divide the current vapor pressure by the saturation vapor pressure and express the answer as a percentage." if the dew point tells us the saturation vapor pressure, though, it seems we are using this equation: relative humidity = saturation vapor pressure/vapor pressure, not the other way around. for example, when the dew point is 7º, the saturated vapor pressure is 10mb, and at 24º, the vapor pressure is 30mb. we do 10/30 right, not 30/10?
06f01d59-ccc6-4293-8df5-0cdbff1c4ad3,so we divide the water vapor content by the water vapor capacity (dew point) then multiply that number by 100%?
