27c6d25f-2eb6-4a57-b93d-78fc587cb8e1,does the semipermanent pressure lows refer to surface air pressure or air pressure higher up in the atmosphere?
a4bacad7-b6e1-4e02-b80e-63a0beb50ea8,if there's wind on one side of a mountain, does that mean that side has saturated air? how were we supposed to know that the left side of the mountain had saturated air, but the right side didn't?

da061f1f-8404-498a-bbbd-57387bbaf22e,wouldn't cold air have higher pressure since it can fit more mass in the same volume?
3408f702-a06f-42d0-a340-496afc3ed8bd,i may be remembering wrong, but i thought that warm air creates a higher volume and flows outwards, causing a decrease in mass/pressure.
not trying to challenge anything, just confused.

cd4e6b5b-6b30-46e4-8949-873e57789ca5,for precipitation fog, if it adds moisture to the air cold enough to create fog near the ground, does that mean that this only happens during the night because the ground is hotter near the surface during the day?
