“Muscles” are composed of muscle tissue and the tendons that attach the muscle tissue to bones.

Muscle tissue is one of four types of body tissues

Muscle structure is hierarchical with connective tissue wrapped around each level of organization.
Muscle - Epimysium


Fascicle - Perimysium


Fiber - Endomysium

4

A muscle fiber (cell) is composed of bundles of myofibrils and is surrounded by the sarcolemma (cell membrane). 
Myofibrils are composed of sarcomeres arranged in series.
5

A sarcomere is the functional contractile unit of a myofibril. Sarcomeres are composed of actin and myosin filaments. 
Titin attaches myosin filaments to Z discs at ends of sarcomere.
6

When activated, myosin cross-bridges bind to actin and rotate, causing the filaments to slide past each other. 
Sarcomeres generate active force when stimulated by nerves. 
7

When sarcomere is too short, number of binding sites is reduced and force is compromised.When sarcomere length is optimal, number of binding sites is max and force is optimal.When sarcomere is too long, binding sites are reduced and force generation is compromised.
Force production depends on the number of cross-bridges. 

Active muscle force depends on sarcomere length.
9

Muscles generate passive force when NOT activated by the nervous system and stretched beyond rest length.

The total force generated by a muscle is the sum of the active force and passive force.

Muscles attach to bones. What happens to muscle length (and force) when a joint changes angle?
Does length 🡹  or  🡻 as joint angle increases?

Elbow

What happens to muscle length when the elbow flexes?
Shortening
Elbow Flexion
Elbow
Shoulder

Muscle design is classified by fiber arrangement. 
15

Longitudinal muscle is long and strap-like with fibers in parallel to long axis

Fusiform muscle is rounded and tapers at either end

Journal of Muscle Foods 17 (2006) 43-55

Quadrate or quadrilateral muscle is four-sided and flat with parallel fibers.
Fan-shaped or triangular muscle has fibers that radiate from a narrow to a broad attachment
18

 
 
 
The angle of the fibers with respect to the tendon is the pennation angle.
19

Unipennate muscle has a series of short, parallel fibers that attach to a long tendon.

Bipennate muscle has a long central tendon with fibers on both sides.

20

Multipennate muscles have a complex design with several tendons and fibers running diagonally between them.
21

These two muscles have about the same amount of muscle tissue. Which muscle produces more force?

An important feature of muscle design is how many sarcomeres are in series or in parallel.
In series
In parallel

The number of sarcomeres in parallel is measured by the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA).
B
Muscle B has more sarcomeres in parallel and greater PCSA than Muscle A. 
A

Muscle force is proportional to PCSA.
A pennated muscle with same thickness (but greater PCSA) as a longitudinal muscle can exert greater force.
25

A muscle force with a larger PCSA produces more force.
Larger PCSA
Smaller PCSA
Force
Length

These two muscles have the same PCSA. Why do they have different force-angle curves?
A
B
27

Muscles with longer fibers can exert force over a greater range of joint angles than a muscle with shorter fibers.
A
B
28

Each sarcomere shortens the same amount. Muscle A can shorten more than Muscle B because it has longer fibers (more sarcomeres in series).
The number of sarcomeres in series determines fiber length. 

Draw Muscle A and Muscle B.
Force
Length

Which curve belongs to Muscle A?
A
B

Human muscles have different lengths and PCSAs. 
What are the functional consequences of each of these designs?

Muscles attach to bones via tendons. The attachment sites of muscles onto bones are called the origin and insertion. 
The origin is usually more proximal than the insertion.
33

Origin
Insertion
Muscle line of pull
Joint
When activated, muscles generate forces that pull on bones. The direction of force is called the muscle line of pull.
34

Muscle force generates torque that tends to rotate the joint in the direction of muscle shortening. 
Muscle torque
Joint
Muscle force
35

Muscle torque
Joint
Muscle force
Moment arm
Muscle torque = Muscle force x moment arm
Moment arm is defined as the perpendicular distance from joint axis of rotation to line of pull of the muscle.
36

Muscles generate force in the direction of shortening. This muscle shortens with flexion, so the muscle torque is in the flexor direction. 
Flexor muscle torque
Joint
Muscle force
37

Which direction of torque is generated by this muscle?
Joint
Muscle force
38

This muscle shortens when the joint extends. It generates extensor torque when it develops force.
Joint
Muscle force
Extensor muscle torque
39

Elbow
Red muscle shortens when the elbow flexes.

Red muscle force produces flexor torque at the elbow.

Red muscle is an elbow flexor.
The function of a muscle is determined by the direction the joint moves when the muscle shortens. 
Muscle function is the same as direction of muscle torque.
40

Elbow
Blue muscle shortens when the elbow extends.

Blue muscle force produces extensor torque at the elbow.

Blue muscle is an elbow extensor.
Muscles on opposites sides of a joint have opposite functions. 
A pair of muscles is needed to control each degree of freedom.
41

How many muscles are needed to control all the movements at the shoulder joint?

Muscle torque
Joint
Muscle force
When muscles generate force while shortening, it is concentric muscle action. 
Flexion
43

The torque generated by the muscle is greater than the externally applied force, and the muscle shortens while generating force.
The arm moves in the same direction as the muscle torque.
>
44

What happens when a muscle tries to shorten, but external torque is greater than the muscle torque? 
The arm moves in the opposite direction as the muscle torque.
<
45

Muscle torque
Joint
Muscle force
When muscles generate force while lengthening, it is eccentric muscle action. 
Extension
46

What type of muscle action is occurring in this pose?
47

Isometric muscle action occurs when the muscle does not change length while generating force.
The arm does not move because the muscle torque is equal and opposite to the externally applied torque.
=
48

More than one muscle can have the same function. Muscles that share a function belong to the same group.
Each of these muscles adducts the hip and is called an agonist for hip adduction. 

All of the muscles belong to the hip adductor group. Because they share the same function, they are called synergists.

Muscles that abduct the hip are called antagonists.
49

=
+
Co-contraction of A and B causes just retraction because upward rotation by A neutralizes downward rotation by B
Muscle B functions are retraction and downward rotation.
Muscle A functions are retraction and upward rotation.
Antagonist muscles can work together to control movement. By neutralizing the undesired function, desired action occurs.
