What is this movement called?

What is the name of this movement of the pelvis?

What is the name of the movement from anatomical position to the position below?

Click on thumb abduction.

What is this movement called?
6

When shoulder is flexed 90 deg, shoulder motions are in the transverse plane and have special names.
Movement away from midline is horizontal abduction.
Movement towards the midline is horizontal adduction.

After completing this module, you will be able to:
List the types of connective tissues found in the skeleton and joints
List the cellular and extracellular components of bone, cartilage and tendon 
Describe the microscopic structure of bone, cartilage and tendon
Explain how bone, tendon/ligament and cartilage structures relate to their functions
Define the types of bones
List the features of a long bone
Define joint structural and functional classifications
Give examples of each type of joint

The skeleton and joint structures are composed primarily of connective tissue
Connective Tissue
Epithelial Tissue
Muscle
Tissue
Nervous
Tissue
Connective tissue is one of four types of body tissues
9

Connective tissues have a common embryonic origin
Embryonic mesenchyme
cells
Connective tissue proper
Cartilage
Bone
Chondrocytes
Osteocytes
Fibrocytes
10

Connective tissue proper
Cartilage
Bone
Each of the connective tissue types is specialized

The extracellular material around the cells differs 
between the types of connective tissues


11

Connective tissue proper
Cartilage
Bone
Dense 
Regular
Irregular 
Elastic
Loose

Connective tissue “connects” structures


12

Dense regular connective tissue is designed to resist being stretched so it is a great material for tendons and ligaments

Relatively few fibrocytes
Collagen fibers in parallel


Ligaments – bone to bone
Tendons – muscle to bone

13

Collagen fibers are arranged in parallel and in same direction as tension forces applied in vivo
Unloaded
Loaded
14

Tendons and ligaments function by resisting being stretched by tension forces

A blow to which side of the knee might tear the medial collateral ligament?
Lateral Collateral Ligament
Medial Collateral Ligament
Medial
Lateral

Tendons and ligaments resist being stretched by producing force. If stretched too much, injury occurs

Tendons have a hierarchical structure with bundles of parallel structures wrapped in coverings

Connective tissue proper
Cartilage
Bone
Hyaline
Fibrocartilage
Elastic

Cartilage connects and cushions structures


19

Cartilage is designed to cushion and support so it is a great material for joints and flexible structures
Extracellular matrix is 70-85% water. Cartilage has no blood vessels.
Hyaline cartilage 
Fibrocartilage
20

Hyaline cartilage covers the end of bones for smooth joint surfaces

Ability of cartilage to resist compression comes from “bottlebrush” structure of proteoglycans in the matrix
Sidechains have a negative charge and repel each other, resisting compression.


Proteoglycans have hyaluronic acid backbone with keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate sidechains.

When cartilage is loaded, proteoglycans resist compression, collagen fibers resist stretching, and fluid moves through the tissue and into joint space

Fibrocartilage is found between vertebrae

Connective tissue proper
Cartilage
Bone
Bone supports and protects structures


Cortical
Trabecular

25

Bone is used to support and protect the body so it is designed to resist compression
Cortical (compact) bone has a dense, regular structure.

Trabecular (spongy) bone is less dense with small spikes of bone.
 
Extracellular matrix in bone has minerals and collagen fibers. Bone tissue is highly vascularized. 
26

Cortical bone covers the surface of bones and trabecular bone is found inside

Cortical bone is organized around blood vessels in cylindrical structures called osteons
28

Cortical bone is strong in compression and weak in shear
Osteons help cortical bone resist compression

Osteoporosis is loss of bone mass with aging
30

Bone tissue is organized into five types of bones
Irregular bones are not hollow.
 
Long bones have a hollow shaft. 
Flat bones are not hollow.
 
Short bones are cube-shaped and are not hollow.
 
Sesamoid bones are found inside tendons.
31

What type of bone is shown?
Anterior

Long bones have marrow cavities and epiphyses
The diaphysis is the hollow shaft surrounded by cortical bone.

An epiphysis is at each end of the long bone that is filled with trabecular bone and surrounded by a shell of cortical bone.
33

Which anatomical feature inspired this art?

The fetal skeleton is made of hyaline cartilage. Bone starts to form at primary centers of ossification.
12 Week Fetus
35

Long bones form by endochondral ossification
36

37

Joints are classified by their structure and function
Limited motion
Free motion
38

In fibrous joints, bones are joined by dense connective tissue with no joint cavity
39

There are three types of fibrous joints
Suture
Syndesmosis
A gomphosis is the type of fibrous joint that holds teeth in the socket.
40

In cartilaginous joints, bones are joined by cartilage with no joint cavity
Fibrocartilage
Hyaline cartilage
41

There are two types of cartilaginous joints
Synchondrosis
Symphysis
42

Synovial joints are mobile and have a fluid filled joint cavity
The bone ends are lined with hyaline cartilage. 
The joint cavity is surrounded by a capsule and is reinforced with ligaments.
Diarthrosis
Synovial
43

Characteristics of a typical synovial joint

How old was this person when the fracture occurred?

Structure of synovial joints
47

Summary of joint types based on structure

Triaxial - three planes
Synovial joints are also classified by type of motion
Non-axial motion
Uniaxial – one plane
Biaxial - two planes
49

Which words best describe this joint?

Hyaline cartilage breaks down in osteoarthritis Bone spurs can form at joint margins
51

Joint space decreases with osteoarthritis 
52

Osteoarthritis
53

Joint replacement may be needed with very severe osteoarthritis to reduce pain
