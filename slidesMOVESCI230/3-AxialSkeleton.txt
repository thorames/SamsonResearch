The skull is composed of bones of the cranium and bones of the face.
Cranial bones
enclose & protect brain
provide muscle attachments

Facial bones
form framework for face
provide cavities for sense 
provide air and food openings
hold the teeth

The occipital bone forms the posterior cranium.
Landmarks on occipital bone:
Foramen magnum
External occipital protuberance

The cranium and face intersect at the orbit.
17

Some joints of the skull allow movement and some do not.
Sutures are fibrous joints.
Temporomandibular joint is synovial.
18

Suture joints of the skull.
Coronal
Sagittal
Lambdoid
19

There is a meniscus (fibrocartilage pad) in the TMJ.
20

TMJ disorders are common due to spasms in chewing muscles, poor fit of teeth, and injury.
21

Describe one difference between the skulls of Homo naledi and Homo sapiens. Use anatomical language!

Next up is the spine portion of the axial skeleton

23

The anatomy of the spine enables important function.
Support
Supports weight of upper body
Acts as shock absorber

Movement 
Permits movement in all directions
Provides attachments for muscles

Protection
Encases and protects spinal cord
24

The vertebrae of the spine are divided into 4 regions.
Cervical vertebrae 
C1-C7

Thoracic vertebrae
T1-T12

Lumbar vertebrae
L1-L5

Sacrococcygeal vertebrae 
Sacrum - 5, fused
Coccyx - 3-4

Below are the landmarks for a typical vertebra. 
28

Put these landmarks in order

Vertebral notch
Intervertebral foramen is created between two adjacent vertebrae.

Spinal nerve roots from the spinal cord exit the intervertebral foramina.
Spinal nerve roots
32

There are 7 vertebrae in the cervical region.
33

Posterior and lateral views of the cervical spine.
34

Click on the transverse process.
35

All cervical vertebrae have transverse foramen. Most cervical vertebrae have a bifid spinous process.
36

The vertebral artery passes through the transverse foramen on the way to the brain.
Vertebral artery
37

Typical cervical vertebrae like C4 have a bifid spinous process but not C1 or C7.
C7 (no)
C1(no)
C4 (yes)
38
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 13a

The shape of each cervical vertebra changes gradually from superior to inferior.
39

C1 and C2 have special names and distinct shapes.
Atlas (C1)
Ring-shaped
No body 
No spinous process


Axis (C2)	
Odontoid process (dens)
40

The C1-C2 articulation is a pivot joint that allows a large amount of rotation in the transverse plane.
41
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 12b

There are 12 vertebrae in the thoracic region. Each thoracic vertebra articulates with a pair of ribs.
42

Click on the place where the thoracic vertebra articulates with a rib.
43

All thoracic vertebrae have articular facets for the ribs.
Articular facets on bodies are demifacets
Articular facets on transverse processes are costal facets
44

“Giraffe face”
The long spinous processes in the thoracic region look like a giraffe face from a posterior view.
45
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 143d

The thoracic vertebrae change shape from superior to inferior.
46

There are 5 vertebrae in the lumbar region.
47

Lumbar vertebrae are large and do not have transverse foramen or articular processes for ribs. 
48

Lumbar vertebrae change shape from L1 to L5.
49

Lumbar vertebrae are massive when viewed from lateral, anterior or posterior views.
50

There are 5 vertebrae fused to form the sacrum. There are 3-4 coccygeal vertebrae.
51

Click on the ventral surface of the sacrum.

Ventral sacral foramina
Sacral promontory
Superior articular process
Coccyx
The anterior surface of the sacrum is smooth. 
53

Features of the sacrum are related to the vertebrae.
Superior articular process

Ribs
The bones of the thorax include the ribs and sternum.
58

Sternum is fused by young adulthood. Ossification of the xiphoid process is highly variable.
Manubrium
Sternal angle
Body
Xiphoid process
59

The ribs, sternum, costal cartilages and thoracic vertebrae form a cage that protects thoracic viscera.
60

Ribs are classified by their anterior articulations. Together the ribs form the subcostal angle.
True ribs
1-7
False ribs
8-12
Floating ribs
11-12
Subcostal angle
61

There are 12 pairs of ribs, one pair for each thoracic vertebra. The shape varies from superior to inferior.
62

Click on the posterior end of the rib.

Landmarks of the ribs:
Head, neck, angle and shaft
Costal groove
Tubercle
Articular facets

                                                                
Ribs are oriented so that the head is posterior and the costal groove is inferior.
Inferior margin is sharp

65

Every rib articulates posteriorly with the body and transverse processes of thoracic vertebrae.
