“Shoulder” is an ambiguous term 
The shoulder girdle includes the clavicle and scapula.
The shoulder joint is between the scapula and humerus.

What is the anatomical name for the “shoulder” joint?
26
Netter

The shoulder articulations include three synovial joints and one other “joint” 
Sternoclavicular joint
Acromioclavicular joint
Glenohumeral joint
Scapulothoracic “joint”
27
Netter

The sternoclavicular joint functionally attaches the shoulder girdle to the axial skeleton
It is a “ball and socket” synovial joint with a meniscus in the joint space.
Fibrocartilage disc
(aka articular disk)

Netter

Ligaments help to maintain the integrity of the sternoclavicular joint

The clavicle can fracture with a blow to the shoulder

The acromioclavicular joint is a non-axial synovial joint that is involved in nearly all shoulder motions
32
Netter

The scapula lies in a plane that is about 40 degrees from the frontal plane

Name these ligaments

Acromioclavicular ligament

Coracoclavicular ligament

A “shoulder separation” occurs when the ligaments supporting the acromioclavicular joint are damaged

Injury results from direct blows to the shoulder or indirectly from impact on an outstretched arm
Increasing severity
The AC ligament is damaged, then with increasing force, the CC ligament can be involved
37
Whiting and Zernicke

The glenohumeral joint is a highly mobile, ball and socket synovial joint
A fibrocartilage rim deepens and widens the socket, adding joint stability 
Glenoid labrum
38
Netter

What is this movement at the glenohumeral joint?

The humerus can impinge on the scapula with abduction of the glenohumeral joint, leading to injury 
Decrease in the subacromial space is called shoulder impingement

The glenoid labrum is injured in a SLAP (superior labrum/anterior-posterior) tear

Glenohumeral ligament

Coracohumeral ligament

The glenohumeral joint is prone to dislocation because of the relatively poor bony fit
Most dislocations (90%) are anterior (e.g., falling backwards onto hand).

The movement of the scapula with respect to the thorax occurs at the scapulothoracic “joint”
46
Netter

Shoulder girdle motions include movements at the AC joint, SC joint and scapulothoracic “joint”
Acromioclavicular Joint
Gliding (limited)

Sternoclavicular Joint
Elevation-depression
Protraction-retraction
Anterior-posterior rotation

Scapulothoracic “Joint”
Elevation-depression
Protraction-retraction 
Upward-downward rotation 
47
Wells

Upward rotation of the scapula is named for the upward motion of the glenoid fossa
48

Coupled motions of the scapula and humerus maintain the glenoid fossa in an optimal position while increasing joint range of motion
