What is this?
38

There are many articulations to learn about in the mobile upper limb
Elbow joint complex
Wrist joint complex
Carpometacarpal joints (CMC)
Metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP)
Interphalangeal joints (IP)
39

The Elbow Joint Complex consists of three articulations inside one synovial joint capsule
Which is anterior?
40

The articulations between humerus and ulna/radius form a hinge joint that allows flexion and extension 
Humeroulnar joint
Trochlea - trochlear notch
Ulnar collateral ligament

Humeroradial joint
Capitulum-radial head
Radial collateral ligament

41

A synovial joint lies between the radial notch on the ulna and the head of the radius.
The articulation between proximal ulna and radius forms a pivot joint for pronation and supination 
Which view shows supination?
42

Ligaments reinforce the synovial joints of the elbow joint complex

Rays 4-5
Are slightly more mobile

Thumb 
Is a saddle synovial joint
Has 2 degrees of freedom
