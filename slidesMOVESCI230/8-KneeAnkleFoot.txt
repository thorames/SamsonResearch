The Q-Angle is the angle formed between the long axis of the femur and the long axis of the tibia
14

What structural aspect of the femur affects Q-angle?

Inclination angle at the hip is related to the Q-angle
Genu varum (bow-legged) 
Associated with coxa valga
Q-angle is less than normal

Genu valgum (knock-kneed)
Associated with coxa vara
Q-angle is greater than normal
16

A small or negative Q-Angle creates genu varum (bowlegged)

A large Q-Angle creates genu valgum (knock-knees).
17
Hamill, Joseph & Knutzen, Kathleen (1995).  Biomechanical Basis of Human Movement.   Baltimore.  Williams & Wilkins.  P232

The Q-angle is measured from the anterior superior spine to the middle of the patella, down to the tibial tuberosity.  Q-angles range from 10 to 14 degrees for males and 15 to 17 degrees for females.  Very small Q-angles create a condition known as genu varum, or bowleggedness.  Large Q-angles create a genu varum, or knock-kneed position.

Rearfoot
Forefoot

Forefoot includes all foot bones except talus and calcaneus  
33

Combined forefoot and rearfoot motions are called supination and pronation
Inversion and eversion occur at the subtalar joint in the rearfoot.


Adduction and abduction occur at the tarsometatarsal joints in the forefoot.


Supination = inversion + adduction
Pronation = eversion + abduction
34

Mobility at the talocrural, metatarsophalangeal and intertarsal joints is needed to stand “on pointe”
35

There are multiple arches in the foot
Longitudinal arch extends from calcaneus to heads of metatarsals. The medial component is more flexible than the lateral component.
Transverse arch extends across anterior tarsals and metatarsals. The arch formed by the metatarsal heads flattens with weight-bearing.
36

Plantar calcaneonavicular (“spring”) ligament
Sustentaculum tali
Navicular
The “spring” ligament supports the talus during weight-bearing

39

Synovial  membrane
The tibiofemoral joint is a synovial joint
Is this anterior or posterior?

Menisci in the knee joint are rims of fibrocartilage on the tibial plateau
Thick at edges, thinner at inner edge
Deepen articular facets of tibia
Absorb shock
42

There are differences in the shape and mobility between the medial and lateral malleoli
Lateral meniscus is nearly a circle.

Medial meniscus is like a C.

Medial meniscus is attached to the medial collateral ligament.

43

The medial and lateral collateral ligaments restrict knee motion in the frontal plane

45
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 479a

Loading of the knee in the frontal plane is called valgus and varus loading 
Valgus loading displaces the distal tibia laterally and stretches the MCL.

Varus loading displaces the distal tibia medially and stretches the LCL.



Anterior cruciate ligament
Lateral femoral epicondyle to Anterior intercondylar eminence on tibia

Posterior cruciate ligament
Medial femoral epicondyle to Posterior intercondylar eminence on tibial plateau
The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are named by their tibial attachments – LAMP

54
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 475b

ACL injuries are more common that PCL injuries
ACLs can be injured in two different ways:
Valgus loading + knee flexion + lateral tibial rotation
Knee hyperextension + medial tibial rotation

Women are at greater risk for ACL injuries than men.
55

Cruciate ligament injury allows “drawer” movement 
Anterior Drawer
Posterior Drawer

Which test demonstrates laxity in the ACL?


“Anterior drawer” test
ACL injury is diagnosed using clinical tests for excessive anterior drawer movement
Lachman test
58

Three structures (“Unhappy Triad”) can be damaged with a lateral blow to the knee
Valgus Load
59

The patellofemoral joint is a synovial joint
60

“Patellar tracking” describes the motion of the patella on the femur during knee flexion
Lateral aspect of posterior patella is vulnerable to damage with poor patellar tracking.
Poor patellar tracking can occur with a shallow notch.
61

Large compression loads combined with poor patellar tracking can lead to “chondromalacia patella”
Damaged hyaline cartilage on posterior lateral patella.
Smooth hyaline cartilage after surgical repair.
62

The patellar ligament connects the patella to the tibial tuberosity
Patellar ligament
63

Osgood-Schlatter disease is injury to the patellar attachment that occurs during adolescence
Growth plate is not closed so it is vulnerable to damage with loading. 

Occurs most frequently in boys 11-15 yo who are active in sports.

Causes swelling and tenderness at anterior proximal tibia.



The “ankle joint” is called the talocrural joint
“Crural” comes from the Latin for leg.
Talus
65
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 482b

The talocrural joint is a uniaxial synovial joint with axis of rotation through the medial and lateral malleoli
The malleoli form the “mortise” of the ankle joint.
Mortise and tenon joint
66

Which movements occur at the talocrural joint?
67

Inversion and eversion occur at the subtalar joint between the talus and calcaneus
The axis of the subtalar joint axis passes  through foot.
68

Motion of the calcaneus at the subtalar joint is best viewed posteriorly
The talus and calcaneus are called the “rearfoot”.

74
Hamilton N. and Luttgens K., Kinesiology Scientific Basis of Human Movement.  10th edition Mc. Grow Hill, Boston, 2002, fig 8.13


Damage to ligaments that reinforce the subtalar joint are called ankle sprains
Most ankle sprains (85%) are inversion injuries.

Typically associated with:
Walking on uneven surfaces
“Rolling over” of the ankle
Landing on obstacle when descending from jump
75

Which ligaments are stretched with excessive inversion of subtalar joint?
Inversion of left ankle
76

With excessive inversion, ligaments on the lateral side of the ankle are at risk for injury
Calcaneus rotates medially and lateral ligaments tear.
77

Which ligaments are stretched with excessive eversion at the subtalar joint?
Eversion of left ankle
78

With excessive eversion, ligaments on the medial side of the ankle are at risk for injury
What is a “high” ankle sprain?
Calcaneus rotates laterally and medial ligaments tear.
79

Lateral cuneiform?
