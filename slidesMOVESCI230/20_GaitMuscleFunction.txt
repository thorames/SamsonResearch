The gait cycle is defined by foot contact events, from foot contact to ipsilateral foot contact.

Percent of Cycle
Hip, knee and ankle joints move in a characteristic pattern during gait.

The hip joint extends during stance and flexes during swing. Hip extensors act concentrically during stance, and hip flexors act eccentrically during stance and concentrically during swing.

The knee joint flexes and extends during stance and swing. Knee extensors act eccentrically then concentrically during stance, and knee flexors act eccentrically during swing.

Hamstrings act synergistically with gluteus maximus at the beginning of stance and at the end of swing.

Plantarflexors act eccentrically then concentrically during stance. Dorsiflexors act eccentrically during the beginning of stance and concentrically at the beginning of swing.

Drop foot
“Drop foot” is a clinical term used to describe the gait pattern associated with weak dorsiflexors.

Excessive adduction in stance can occur with weak abductors.
19

“Trendelenburg gait” is the name of the characteristic gait pattern associated with weak abductors.
20

To compensate for weak abductors, body weight is shifted over the weakened side during stance.
