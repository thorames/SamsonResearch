Participating in class improves exam scores
Gross et al. (2017) Anat Sci Educ 

There are many ways to make your grade
Your grade depends on the points you earn in the course – you start with a score of 0 and accumulate points by completing exams and assignments

Predict your score using Grade Predictor with Gradecraft tool

Letter grade in class depends on the number of points that you earn throughout the semester – see Syllabus for details

It is important to pay close attention to assignment options and due dates in Gradecraft!

 1-Basic Concepts
12

After this module, you will be able to:
Define anatomical position
Define the body planes and axes
Use anatomical language to describe the body
Use anatomical language to describe movement

Anatomical language is needed to describe body position, directions and movements without ambiguity
14

Anatomical position is the reference point for describing body directions and movements
15

Anatomical directions orient the body

Anatomical directions help navigation
Anterior / Posterior = toward front / back
Medial / Lateral = toward / away from body midline
Superior / Inferior (trunk) = above / below
Proximal / Distal (limbs) = toward / away from trunk
Palmar / Dorsal (hands) = toward / away palm of hand
Plantar / Dorsal (feet) = toward / away sole of foot
Superficial / Deep = toward / away from body surface 


17

The shoulder is proximal to the wrist in all positions

Cranial is towards the head
Caudal is towards the tail
Ventral is towards the belly
Dorsal is towards the back.
Anatomical directions differ for quadripeds

The sagittal, frontal and transverse planes are defined relative to the trunk position

The sagittal plane slices the body into right and left sides
A sagittal section “cuts” the body parallel to sagittal plane 
21

The frontal plane slices the body into front and back parts
A frontal section “cuts” the body parallel to the frontal plane 
22

The transverse plane slices the body into top and bottom parts
A transverse section “cuts” body parallel to the transverse plane
23

Body movements in the sagittal plane rotate about a medial-lateral axis
Sagittal plane movements are best seen from the side
24

Body movements that rotate around the same axis 
but in opposite directions have different names

Extension
Flexion
Flexion and extension are sagittal plane movements
26

More examples of flexion and extension
27

Examples of hip flexion and extension
28

Which direction is knee flexion?
29

Extension past anatomical position is hyperextension
30

More examples of hyperextension
31

Sagittal ankle movements have special names
Dorsiflexion
Plantarflexion
32

 Body movements in the frontal plane rotate about an anterior-posterior axis
Frontal plane movements are best seen from the front or back
33

Abduction movements occur in the frontal plane and move body segments away from the midline
34

Adduction movements occur in the frontal plane and move body segments towards the midline
35

Frontal spine movements are called lateral flexion 
Direction of motion corresponds to the person who is moving
Right lateral flexion
36

Transverse plane movements rotate about a vertical axis
Transverse plane movements are best seen from a bird’s eye view
37

Lateral
Rotation
Medial
Rotation
Transverse limb movements are named with respect to the midline of the body 
Medial rotation is towards midline, 
lateral rotation is away from midline
38

Right
Left
Transverse trunk movements are named with respect to the side of the body
Right rotation goes to mover’s right, and left is opposite
Right
Rotation
Left
Rotation
39

Transverse forearm movements have special names
Pronation
Supination
40

When movement crosses planes and body segments move in a circle, movement is called circumduction
41

Anterior Tilt     
Sagittal pelvis movements have special names 
Posterior Tilt
Name corresponds to direction that superior pelvis moves

Depression
Elevation
Sagittal jaw movements have special names
Protraction
Retraction
43

Right Tilt     
Pelvis frontal movements have special names 
Left Tilt
Name corresponds to side of pelvis that moves downward

Radial Deviation towards thumb
Ulnar Deviation towards pinky
Frontal wrist movements have special names
45

Inversion is when the medial border of the foot lifts up
Eversion is when the lateral border of the foot lifts up
Foot movements in the frontal plane have special names. Where is the axis of rotation?
46

Shoulder girdle motions have special names 
Upward movement is elevation 
Downward movement is depression 
47

When the inferior border of the scapula rotates upward, the movement is called upward rotation 
48

Left Rotation
Transverse pelvis movements correspond to the direction of movement of the anterior pelvis
Right Rotation

Transverse shoulder girdle movements have special names
Forward rotation is protraction
Backward rotation is retraction 
Protraction
Retraction
50

Thumb movements are different than fingers 
Thumb flexion/extension
Finger abduction/adduction
FRONTAL PLANE
Thumb abduction/adduction
Finger flexion/extension
SAGITTAL PLANE
