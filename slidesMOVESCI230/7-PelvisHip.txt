After completing this module, you will be able to:
Name and identify the major landmarks on the coxal bones and femur
Be able to orient a coxal bone and femur and identify them as right or left
Describe sex differences in the pelvis
Know what type of joints occur between the bones of the pelvis, the sacrum and the femur
Name and identify ligaments of the sacroiliac and hip joints 
Describe the angle of inclination and how it relates to coxa vara and coxa valga
Explain avascular necrosis
Describe a typical hip fracture and why it occurs

The lower extremity includes the pelvic girdle and bones of the thigh, leg and foot 
3

The pelvic girdle is formed from bones belonging to the axial and appendicular skeleton
Coxal bones (appendicular)


Sacrum (axial)
The coxal bone is sometimes called the innominate bone.
4

Ilium - superior
Ischium - posterior
Pubis - anterior
Acetabulum
Three bones fuse to form the coxal bone 
The three bones come together in the acetabulum
Obturator Foramen
The coxal bones have two landmarks.

The pelvic girdle is formed by the sacrum and coxal bones
How would you describe the orientation of the acetabula?
18

Bones in the pelvic girdle are bound together by both synovial and fibrocartilagenous joints
Sacroiliac joint is a non-axial synovial joint with limited motion.

The pubic symphysis is a fibrocartilage joint with limited mobility.
19

The pubic symphysis can separate during childbirth 
Non-pregnant < 5mm
Pregnant 1-12 mm (relaxin)
Rupture incidence 1/30,000 deliveries

There are sex differences in the shape of the pelvis
Female pelvis:
 Pelvic inlet transversely oval
 Pubic symphysis shorter
 Pubic arch wider
 Ischial spines farther apart
 Iliac wings more flared
Male pelvis:
 Pelvic inlet AP oriented
 Pubic symphysis taller
 Pubic arch narrower
 Ischial spines closer
 Iliac wings less flared
24
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 336a

Some dimensions of the pelvis are particularly important for childbirth
Inferior view of pelvic outlet:
 Transverse diameter ~11 cm 
 AP diameter varies from 9.5-11.5 cm (coccyx mobility)

Which pelvis is female?
26

The shape of the human pelvis is different from our hominid ancestors
“Lucy”
 Australopithecine female 
3 million years ago
Discovered in 1974


What are the implications of the shape of Lucy’s pelvis?
Modern
Lucy
27

The orientation of the ilia and the size and shape of the pelvis has evolved
Chimpanzee
Ilia lie almost flat on back 
Small pelvic inlet
Lucy
Ilia rotated laterally
Sacrum has widened
Modern human
Ant-posterior expansion
Ovoid birth canal

Click on the most distal medial posterior aspect of the femur

The angle between the neck and shaft of the femur in the frontal plane is called the Inclination Angle
The typical inclination angle is 125 degrees.
Coxa vara (less than 125 deg)
Coxa valga (greater than 125 deg)

The adult femur varies in size and shape
Anterior or posterior view?

Which femur might be associated with “knock knees”?
36

1 yr
The femur is typically fused by early college years
6 yr
Proximal femur fused by age 18 
Distal femur fused by age 20 
37

The hip joint is a ball and socket synovial joint
The socket is deepened with a rim of fibrocartilage called the acetabular labrum.
38

The blood supply to the femoral head passes through a ligament inside the joint capsule
Round ligament (with blood supply)
39
Netter FH.  Atlas of Human Anatomy.  Ciba-Geigy, NJ, 1995. Figure 458c

If the blood supply entering through the round ligament is compromised, avascular necrosis results

The hip joint is reinforced with ligaments
Iliofemoral ligament
Pubofemoral ligament
Ischiofemoral ligament
41

Which ligament limits hip hyperextension?

Hip hyperextension is quite limited. How does she appear to have 90 deg of hip hyperextension? 
43

“Hip fracture” is a fracture of the proximal femur 
44

The proximal femur is vulnerable to fracture with osteoporotic loss of trabecular bone
Trabeculae
Stress pattern
Severity of bone loss is used to grade extent of osteoporosis
Bone is lost according to amount of stress on proximal femur - less stress, more loss
45

Osteoarthritis is a common joint disorder that affects the hip and can lead to joint replacement
Progressive condition
Softening and thinning of articular cartilage due to decrease in proteoglycans in matrix
Cartilage surface becomes rough with pits, fissures and ulcers
Subchondral bone necrosis and osteophyte formation at joint margins

Two types
Primary - idiopathic (unknown origin)
Secondary - trauma, inflammation, etc


46

The acetabular opening typically faces slightly anterior
Retroversion
Anteversion (typical)
With retroversion, the acetabular opening faces slightly posterior.

47

Which image shows acetabular retroversion?

Acetabular retroversion can cause impingement of the femur during movement
