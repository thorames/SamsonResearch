And you can see how these areas of high wind speed-- color here means 'wind speed.' So the highest wind speeds are occurring generally in these prevailing westerlies, from west to east. Looks like we have lots of good questions come in, so, let's-- let's see what you got here. The Intertropical Convergence Zone is storms that form along the Equator. So, you've got lots of good questions here. And the question for you is: what wind direction would you expect at that orange dot? What would you expect to be the prevailing wind flow at that orange dot? And as you'd make that choice, I want you to think through why-- what logic you'd use to explain that. From what direction would you expect the wind to be blowing at that dot? What do you think? East? Most of you are probably thinking 'east.' What would be your logic for 'east'? Yeah. And because of that, what's going to happen in the upper atmosphere is the air is gonna expand over the Sahara. You have to have the Coriolis force, as you'll see in a minute, for the storm-- once they begin, once we create these random thunderstorms, you gotta organize them. Once you get a low pressure at the ground, the Coriolis force kicks in, and these clouds now begin to rotate around the central low pressure system. It's still at that stage where the storm is-- you know, the clouds are in the same pattern that are beginning to rotate around a central low pressure, but it's not so intense yet that-- to produce subsidence in the center.
