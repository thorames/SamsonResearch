Upper left-hand corner is going to be, always, the temperature. If the number starts with a 'nine' or an 'eight,' then you put a 'nine' in front of it. Key to finding fronts on a weather map is to first find the center of low pressure. Where is the pressure lowest on the map? Fronts are almo-- well, in this class, always connected to the center of low pressure. And you're just gonna draw a line, smoothly, through those dots to indicate where the-- the temperatures are greater than 70 on one side, and less than 70 on the other side. Don't be anal about it, 'cause it's-- it's just-- it's gonna be hard to draw lines to keep everything on one side, and less than 1000, and greater than 1000; 1004, 1008 in four-millibar increments. You're only looking at the upper left-hand corner in order to get temperature. All temperatures greater than 50 on one side; less than 50 on the other. But there really isn't a-- area of strong temperature contrast; a gradient across the map. And this-- this area here; that's probably the center of low pressure, somewhere around here.
