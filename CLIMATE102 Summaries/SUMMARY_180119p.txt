You can see through the ice cores here that when temperature goes up, carbon dioxide has gone up as well. Carbon dioxide is being removed, because this water is getting cold, and then sinking in the bottom of the oceans. And here's an example from history, 10,000 years ago or so, called the 'Younger Dryas period.'  When this cold water changed, it messed up that sinking of carbon dioxide in the Northern Atlantic. Each molecule of a greenhouse gas has a different potential to absorb radiation. And it turns out that the potential for methane to absorb radiation is like 1000 times greater than a molecule of carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide temperat-- carbon dioxide concentrations over the last 10,000 years have been remarkably consistent. And we can see from the measurements in the ice cores, and now, atmospheric measurements, how the temperature-- how the carbon dioxide concentrations have changed in the last thousand years. Remember that methane is a concentration that's probably like 1000 times less than carbon dioxide. How much of the stuff is there in the atmosphere?  How efficient is the molecule of the greenhouse gas at absorbing the longwave radiation?  And how long is that stuff gonna be there?  And the combination of these things allow us to calculate what we call the 'global warming potential.'  And this is done relative to carbon dioxide. It-- the potential of a molecule of any gas relative to carbon dioxide.
