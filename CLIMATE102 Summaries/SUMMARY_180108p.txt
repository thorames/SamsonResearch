So, at the same elevation, there's a pressure gradient, then, from south to north. And as we'll come back to later in this semester, this change of temperature with distance produces a pressure gradient in the upper atmosphere, which is going to produce winds above us. So the air wants to move from south to north because of this pressure gradient. That produces this pressure gradient in the upper atmosphere. And what we're gonna discover over the course of the semester here, is the places on the ground where temperature changes fastest, are gonna be the places where there're gonna be the strongest winds in the upper atmosphere. But we're far enough away, and with the right amount of pressure, that on our planet, liquid water could form. 'Nitrogen, the only gas that is not soluble in water, of all the gases emitted by volcanoes. So, 'nitrogen's emitted from volcanoes, as are other gases. And of the gases, nitrogen is the only one that is not soluble in water.'  So, that's what we're kinda looking for, when you answer this question on the exam, is that you talk through the various points that we've made here, leading to formation of nitrogen-- nitrogen as our dominant gas. And here, what we're seeing is-- the first layer of the atmosphere is called the 'troposphere,' where temperatures generally decrease with altitude.
