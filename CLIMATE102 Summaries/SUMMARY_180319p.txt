And these waves in the upper atmosphere will then dip down ahead of the cold front, and come back up again in these areas where they-- kind of rises back up again. And we have-- we've-- I've have mentioned the 500-millibar level, halfway through the atmosphere. Now, the 500-millibar level is important to us, because halfway through the atmosphere pretty much represents the wind that's gonna be moving the storm. So this gust front comings out, intercepts this warm moist air here, and triggers a new thunderstorm on the southern edge of the downburst, like point one, here. And the same thing happens again, where this storm-- now, gets a downburst, and it produces a new thunderstorm here, at point one. The top of the cloud, with the ice crystals, is gonna have a positive charge. And think again about the last time you saw a lightning bolt. And here's a case in Switzerland of a lightning strike going from ground to-- initiated from ground to cloud, where the stepped leader went upwards in all directions, made contact, and so it's the return-stroke from cloud to ground, in this case. Something we-- you will see in your lifetime, potentially, is something called 'Saint Elmo's Fire.' 'Saint Elmo's Fire' is that part that where the charge is coming up from the ground. And from the tops of the masts, you'd have this fire-- so-called 'fire'-- coming up off the tops of the masts, where the charge was emanating from the ground, back towards the cloud.
