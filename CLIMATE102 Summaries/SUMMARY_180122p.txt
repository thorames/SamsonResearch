Given all this is happening, and given that-- given that these are greenhouse gases-- and they will absorb longwave radiation coming from the ground, they will absorb it-- do not say, 'Reflect it.'  They will absorb that radiation coming from the ground, energizes the molecule, and then it re-releases that energy back, up and down. And by the year 2100, they're gonna be somewhere between-- what's that?  Five hundred, and maybe as high as 800 parts per million. So we're going up to maybe somewhere between-- maybe, say 500, 600 parts per million. So, here is a graph of temperatures, and then you get-- let's say Ann Arbor. If the temperatures get too high, the daisies die. And at that point-- at that point, all the daisies will die, because there's no-- we're at such a hot temperature that daisies can't grow anymore, and life on Daisyworld ends. Yes, makes the temperatures grow to a spot here where the daisies can't grow anymore. I've talked, so far, about we're adding moisture to the atmosphere, and it's gonna cause air conditioning; it's gonna cause more water vapor, which is a greenhouse gas. And now the extent of the ice is getting smaller, the ice is getting thinner. Yeah, what could go wrong there?  Are sensitive to changes in land use, which may-- could reasonably cause temperatures to change rapidly there.
