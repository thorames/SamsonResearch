And it gets to a spot where the temperature eats-- equals dew point. And if you hike into this, you know, it's gonna be a sunny day until you get up into the top of the mountain there, when you're gonna just be totally in a fog, as this cloud envelops you. The dew point's down two degrees, also 10 degrees. So it's only gonna fall at six degrees per kilometer, and the dew point also is gonna fall at six degrees per kilometer. Now, going down the other side, what's the temperature gonna be at the bottom down here? 'Cause once you go over the top, on the way down, the temperature is going to be warming at the dry adiabatic lapse rate. The dew point's gonna be five degrees, so the cloud's gonna form at 500 meters. And eventually, you get to the point where the temperature and dew point equ-- are equal to each other. And then they hit-- hit the Michigan side here, and suddenly the air is-- hits friction again. So it's like the air is piling up as-- on the west side of Michigan, and the air has to go somewhere, so it's-- the infor-- it reinforces the convection that's been happening all across the lake, and makes it even stronger here, just on the downwind side of the lakes. And then you hit the-- here, on the Michigan side, the air's gotta slow down because of the extra friction.
