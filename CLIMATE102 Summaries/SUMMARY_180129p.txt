First is what we call 'absolute humidity.'  A mass of water vapor in a fixed volume of air. How much moisture can the atmosphere hold?  And you're gonna wanna have this graph. What's-- other measures of humidity, given just temperature and dew point?  So, let's talk about relative humidity now. What's the relative humidity?  Temperature is 20 degrees, and the dew point is 15 degrees. That gives us 'how much moisture could the air hold.'  Because at 20 degrees, the air could hold-- uh, whatever that is. And the relative humidity is 50 percent. And I told you the relative humidity is 50 percent of that. I could tell you dew point is 10, and the relative humidity is 50 percent. What's the dew point temperature?  It's somewhere around 20. Which air is heavier?  Phoenix air, at 95 degrees and 15 percent humidity, or the Houston air, at 95 degrees and 85 percent humidity.
