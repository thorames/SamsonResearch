So in order to get that sort of rotation in the storm-- to get that much energy to cause an entire atmosphere to start rotating, it's gonna take a lot of convection. The answered-- most people think 'yes.' And the answer's likely 'no.' In order to get a storm large enough to produce a tornado, that storm is gonna be so tall that you got these tremendously strong updrafts. Gets caught in an updraft again, gets carried back up. The outflow causes the air, then, to rise up even faster in the storm, adding more energy to the storm. Causes the air to rise up again faster. Is it gonna get worse? And why-- why do you think so, or not? Okay, many of you think it's gonna get worse. Warm, moist air near the ground; cold, dry air above it. Convective instability requires a), warm, moist air near the ground. Is that gonna-- is air gonna get warmer and moisture near the ground? Yeah, it is. But oddly enough are-- these computer models suggest that that-- the wind shear near the ground is actually gonna get stronger.
