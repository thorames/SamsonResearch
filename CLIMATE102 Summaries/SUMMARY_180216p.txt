If you have a larger temperature contrast on the ground-- we've already been through this-- you know, one air is expanded and one air is not, it causes a stronger pressure gradient in the upper atmosphere. That's making the jet stream upstairs stronger, which makes that divergence upstairs stronger, which removes more air from that spot on the ground. And that strong temperature change causes the upper atmosphere to produce a strong jet stream, which produces strong divergence. So you've got a very much warmer maritime tropical air coming in off the Gulf Stream, meeting what's probably continental polar here on the-- on land, which is cold this time of year. And that's the next stage of the storm formation. And it's going to stay over that spot where the temperature contrast is greatest on the ground. That causes the greatest pressure gradient aloft, which is then gonna cause the strongest jet stream in the upper atmosphere. And that mature stage just-- just pressure gradient in the upper atmosphere is just really strong now. And 'where is the warm air' controls where the jet stream is above it, which controls the divergence in the atmosphere, and causes the low pressure to get stronger. The pressure is lowering at a rapid rate, because of that jet stream and divergence in the upper atmosphere.
