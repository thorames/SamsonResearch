So you can see, uh, Baja, California right here. And so the question is: why exactly are these atmospheric rivers associated with a lot of rain and snow? Well, if you look at the average amount of water that's transported within these atmospheric rivers, that's actually equivalent to what we see at the mouth of the Mississippi River. So atmosphere rivers are kind of called the 'hurricanes of the West Coast.' So if you're looking at the intensity of precipitation for atmospheric rivers, um, what you see in this figure is each colored dot corresponds to a station. So looking at the West Coast, all of the colored dots on the West Coast are actually attributable to atmospheric rivers. The figure on the right shows the Sierra Nevada snowpack after a very active atmospheric river season. And, you know, you can kind of see, one thing that comes out very clearly is, you know, the highest precipitation's actually falling over the mountains, which corresponds to what I was saying earlier. So that was the largest recorded fire in California history. So, a lot-- a lot of rain, um, that's connected to these Gulf Coast atmospheric rivers. Um, and this figure on the bottom just shows a season, showing these atmospheric river events as they make landfall along the coast. So, what influences atmospheric river intensity? So what this shows is a comparison between strong atmospheric rivers and weak atmospheric rivers, before they make landfall.
