So a Fujita scale of three is a wind speed of about 158 miles an hour. You're gonna see that this rotation is so focused on one spot. So the right side of the tornado's gonna cause more damage than the left side. And again, when that happens, when we get these multiple vortices, then the damage is gonna be greatest on the right side of the tornado. It turns out that these suction vortices generally are gonna occur and be strongest on the right side of the tornado. So the greatest damage is gonna be to the right of center of the whole tornado. This-- these storms are wind speeds in excess of 200 miles an hour. This, thanks to Google, there's a map of Greensburg, Kansas, before the tornado hit. And as that rotation gets focused on one spot, then a tornado can form there. And you can see it here, how the suction vortices forming extra-- on the right, this thing is moving towards them.
