Associated then with these sorts of storms-- not only do we get the hail, and the rain, but when you-- especially in a storm with-- with hail like that, the capacity for the rain and the hail to drag air towards the ground is pretty strong. That air hits the ground and spreads out in all directions, causing a gust front. And you get trees kind of splayed out from a central core spot. Uh, and maybe there's a little bit of fl-- maybe this storm was moving from the upper left corner to the little right corner. So now, the storm is moving-- moving from left to right here. So the combination of the storm movement, plus the downburst, pushing out away from the center. Take a few of these storms and line them up, and all the storms-- each of them are producing sort of a gust out in front of the storm. The storm is moving from left to right, in this case. These storms are, you know, in a line, and each of them is producing a gust front and this-- the corresponding damage as the storm approaches here. Once you have created that-- a line of storms, and the storms are producing that outflow in front of the strong straight-line winds, that's gonna cause the air to get-- be pushed up into the storm at a higher rate of speed.
