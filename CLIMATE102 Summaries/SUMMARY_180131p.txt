Well, it's the vapor pressure over ice. That if you're a water vapor molecule, and you're sitting in an environment where you've got some ice crystals, and you've got some water, and they're both the same temperature, your preference is gonna be to go to the ice crystal, 'cause it takes a lower vapor pressure. Well, the vapor pressure over ice is less than the vapor pressure over water, so the water vapor in the atmosphere heads over to the ice. The water vapor moves, and the ice crystal will grow at the expense of the water drop. 'Cause the vapor pressure over ice is lower than the vapor pressure over water. The saturation vapor pressure over ice is lower than that over water. And this-- ice crystals will grow, then, at the expense of the water drop. And in that environment, the ice crystals will grow at the expense of the water drops. The vai-- vapor pressure over silver iodide is gonna be less than the vapor pressure over water. The ice crystals will grow large enough, and precipitation will occur, and we can trick clouds into precipitating.
