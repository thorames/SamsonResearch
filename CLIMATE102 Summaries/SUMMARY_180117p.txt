We are tilted, now, away from the Sun, because of the tilt of the Earth at twenty-three and a half degrees. Likewise, another periodicity of about 400,000 years in our-- in our orbit. It's tilted by twenty-three and a half degrees, relative to the elliptical plane of the sun, relative to our orbit around the sun. So on average, right now, we're at twenty-three and a half degrees tilt, but that tilt changes a little bit over time. And right away, each of these helps us go back and identify when ice ages happened in the past. And you want a small Earth-Sun distance in summertime. A large Earth-Sun distance in wintertime. The drought conditions in the Great Plains, precipitation in the Himalayas, and other measures of meteorology do show a correlation with the number of sunspots. So we actually have a record of how CO2 has been changing; how greenhouse gases have been changing over hundreds of thousands of years. When carbon dioxide's at a high value, the temperatures are higher.
