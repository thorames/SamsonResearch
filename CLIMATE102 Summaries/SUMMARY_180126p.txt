So it's gone cooling by that much, in units of watts per meter squared. Well, there's been some increase in sunspot activity, and that would have caused about this much change, then, in total watts per meter squared. The changes in greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide, methane, et cetera, are here, though, and they dominate by a long shot over any other factor that we can find. Average precipitation from 1986 to 2005 versus 2081 to 2100. The changes in average surface temperature from 1986 to 2005, versus in the future, at 2081 to 2100. But once you start melting the Arctic Ocean, and the temperatures aren't as cold there anymore, that-- that-- that jet stream doesn't know what to do. Yeah, so this is just-- tries to describe-- here's a-- sort of a normal case, where it's cold over the Arctic Ocean, and you have this nice, sort of circular pattern, and the jet stream would just stay circular around it. In the highest scenario, that's an eight-foot rise in global sea level. And like the Arctic, it then-- it gets this feedback mechanism, which is gonna cause the Antarctic to melt even faster. It's gonna cause glaciers to melt even faster.
