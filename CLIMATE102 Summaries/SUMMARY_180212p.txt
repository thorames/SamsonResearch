Gets pulled to the right by the Coriolis force. You answered it right, didn't you? I asked you, 'Which way is the pressure gradient force?' in this question. So pressure gradient would be to the west. What direction is the pressure gradient force? When-- that question, when I ask it that way, should be 'west.' I'm really screwing today's lecture up. And the key to this-- if you do-- on the next exam, is when I put it down on the map and I ask you, 'Which direction is the Coriolis force?', the first thing you're gonna do is say, 'Well, which way is the wind blowing?' And once you've done that, then you know the Coriolis force has to be to the right of whatever wind direction you choose. Even if you choose the wrong wind direction, make darn sure that the Coriolis force is to the right of that direction. 'Cause the wind is blowing from the south, and the Coriolis force is gonna be to the right of it. In the Northern Hemisphere, low pressure is such that the air is spiraling in in a counterclockwise way. Do that spiral thing, and spiraling out in a counterclockwise way from the high pressure system. It'd be flowing out of the high pressure in a counterclockwise way.
