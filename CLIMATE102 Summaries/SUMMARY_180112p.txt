The ground warms up, and it's then gonna radiate energy, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law-- it's gonna radiate energy back out to space. And the radiation is less likely to be absorbed-- this IR-- infrared radiation is less likely to be absorbed as it passes back out through the atmosphere. The ground is likely to be warmer, because the radiation that's leaving the ground, the infrared radiation, is absorbed by the water vapor as a greenhouse gas, and then-- and then redistributed back down to the ground. So the more greenhouse gases we put in the atmosphere, the more of this radiation gets absorbed, the warmer it makes the atmosphere, and more the atmospheric can then re-radiate energy back down to the ground. In the absence of the sun, then this longwave radiation cycling here is dominant in controlling the temperatures on Earth. At nighttime, then, nighttime temperatures on our Earth are rising faster than daytime temperatures. And those nighttime temperatures are rising faster than the daytime temperatures. 'Cause remember, the water in the atmosphere is an important greenhouse gas. And the rule behind that is this understanding we call the 'specific heat capacity.'  The-- it's the heat required to raise the mass of a substance by one degree of temperature. So, if you beam sunlight onto sand, and you beam it onto water, uh, in the same amount of energy, how much will their temperatures change?  The equation-- the mathematical English here is that 'heat supplied is equal to the mass times the heat-- specific heat capacity, times the change in temperature.'  Or this equation down here.
