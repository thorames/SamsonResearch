And the slope-- the slope becomes steeper, the higher you go in the atmosphere. We will see the jet stream here, as the red area-- high wind speeds. The jet stream is gonna be-- place where the strong temperature contrast exists. If you have a temperature contrast on the ground, you know from what we just did this morning, it's gonna cause, then, stronger winds in the upper atmosphere. And you're gonna know the jet stream, because it's-- it's like a river of high wind speeds. So divergence in the upper atmosphere is exactly linked to the formation of the low pressure in the storm system at the surface. It's creating a stronger temperature contrast on the ground, which is going to, then, cause the wind speeds upstairs to get stronger. And the wind speeds up here'll continue to get stronger, as long as there's good temperature contrast across the storm. Bigger-- pulling cold air further south, and warm air further north. And that storm which we're-- see forming over Iowa right now is right there, to the east of the loc-- low pressure trough in the upper atmosphere.
