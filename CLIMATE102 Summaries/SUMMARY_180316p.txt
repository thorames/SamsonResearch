And you know that as you raise air, it's gonna cool at the dry or the moist adiabatic lapse rate. Inside the cloud, the air is still saturated, so it's warming at the moist adiabatic lapse rate on the way down. So the air continues to warm at the moist adiabatic lapse rate. Because the air rising is gonna be warming at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, then moist. And then, on the way down, it's gonna be warming at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, all the way towards the ground. This gust front is gonna come back, and we'll talk about it ev-- most every day for the next week, because that turns out to be a process where the storm is basically building its own system. The temperature's gonna fall at the dry adiabatic lapse rate, because it's not saturated. Nonetheless, even if it did evaporate-- I mean, it didn't evaporate, this water would-- this air would continue to warm, but still continue to warm at the moist adiabatic lapse rate. And we'll come back and talk about the gust front, because this leads into yet another thunderstorm process, called the 'derecho.' Which is it-- going to be a-- basically, in that case, you have a line of thunderstorms, and each thunderstorm is producing its own gust front. But, the-- we're gonna come back and talk about this next week, because that roll cloud does play a big role in tornado formation.
