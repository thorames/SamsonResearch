And as they do that, they're gonna get right into the middle of the down-- microburst-- the downburst here, which is then gonna be pushing the plane towards the ground. The air at the top would be maybe somewhere around-- it's saturated, so it's minus five degrees Centigrade. On the way down, then, the logical question is: what would the temperature be in Boulder, if the air at the top is minus five, saturated at minus five, and it's going to sink. It is a high-wind storm, simply picking up whatever is available to be blown around. So, like the air that's now flowing down the topography in Greenland, in this case, there is-- often in the summertime, a big high pressure system sitting over-- over Utah. And that's trouble, if then, somehow a fire starts, uh, somewhere along the coast of California here. Because those-- it's gonna be very dry conditions under high wind speeds, and that's probably the worst possible thing that can happen if you're trying to fight a fire. If we have a big high pressure system that isn't moving, it's called-- it's called a 'blocking high.' 'Blocking' in that it won't allow a rain event to come in. That's a 'blocking high.' And I point that out because it can-- contrast that with another kind of high pressure system you're gonna hear about in the news, called an 'omega blocking high.' And 'omega' is similar, but it's got this odd pattern. The most famous monsoonal course happens in Asia, where the center of the Asian continent gets hot, and the air comes rushing in from all directions.
