And you might well ask me-- and by the way, don't be shy about ever just raising your hand, and go, 'What the heck, Perry?'  You know, wha-- how do you know-- how did you measure temperature 600,000 years ago?'  A reasonable question. If you melt the ice in the Arctic, it turns out that the jet stream is attached to the Arctic ice. How often does that happen?  So if it happened every-- if 't' is one-- 100 years here, then your probability is one over 100, or one percent. If you have a storm with a, say, one-- it's a 100-year storm, it's going to happen once every hundred years. So any given year, your probability of that happening is what?  It is one. Hundred-year storms don't necessarily happen every hundred years. If the probability of getting a 'one' on a throw is one over six, or 17 percent, then the probably of not throwing a 'one' is 83 percent. Are you with me that-- that far?  The probability of not getting a 'one' is 83 percent. So, in this case, not throwing a 'one' is an 83 percent chance. On any given throw, your probability of not throwing a 'one' is 83 percent.
