Is the storm going through an eyewall replacement? If it is, that's good news, because that means the storm is gonna be less powerful. And there's this-- this one little loop of really, really warm water extending into the Gulf of Mexico. When we're having an El Ni–o, that produces, then, a change in the wind flow in the tropics such that there's a stronger wind shear in the Caribbean. So because of El Ni–o, we get this high wind shear; winds moving in different directions over the Caribbean ocean. To model these storms-- we've not yet talked about modeling, but people in my department run these large, global models of weather. And the power of the wind, as this equation shows here, is proportional to-- that's what that means-- the density of the fluid-- whether it's water or air-- times the speed, cubed. And each of those grid points, calculate what's the wind speed, at that elevation, at that spot, inside the hurricane? And from that, knowing the density of air, we can calculate the power of a hurricane. But the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes is gonna go up by 200 percent. First of all, we haven't talked a lot about these global climate models, but here, if you run the global climate model, and you leave out-- you just keep carbon dioxide and the greenhouse gases the same, you get the blue line. While the Category 4 and 5 hurricanes increase in number over time.
