Again, there's that '-nimbus,' meaning that you have a cumulus cloud that is producing some sort of rainfall, some sort of precipitation. Cirrocumulus, your cirrostratus, and your cirrus clouds are up there. Here, again, are your middle clouds at altocumulus and altostratus. So it's basically just sort of that dim-- when you look up in the sky, you can see the sun. Nimbostratus, stratus, and stratocu. Basically, you can see that base of that cloud is fairly low to the ground, um, and-- but there is still some vertical development to it, and there's a nice sort of uniform edge to it. But it doesn't get a whole lot of vertical development from it. You can see a lot more of vertical development here. Now it wants to sink down, because it's colder than the surrounding air. Alright, let's see how everybody's doin' here.
