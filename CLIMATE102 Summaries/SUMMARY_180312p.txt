Only when you finally hit temp-- wind speed of 74 miles an hour do we start calling it a 'hurricane.' And at that point, at 74 miles an hour, the wind itself can do a fair amount of damage. What?' So you're standing-- and if you're standing like-- this is even in a wind speed-- this is still Category 1. That gives you a sense for even a Category 1, it's gonna be a pretty impressive wind speed. That is, you can see the eye of the hurricane in satellite pictures. But it's moving onshore; here the air's flowing in a counterclockwise way, so if you carry that towards shore, then this part of the storm is gonna come onshore with-- what's gonna come onshore, with winds onto the shore. So the storm surge-- the capacity to carry water onshore-- is usually gonna be just to the right of the center of the storm. And back then, as it came across Florida, we expected this hurricane is going to turn around and track back in towards Tampa here. I know you can see the rotation, the air flowing into the hurricane in a counterclockwise way. It's gonna get the greatest storm surge.' And yes, they did. Now, Sandy has this situation going on that this is the ki-- the same kind of hurricane that produced what we call the 'perfect storm.' With a-- remember the movie with George Clooney? That was a perfect storm; a combination of a hurricane and a synoptic-scale cyclogenesis coming together.
