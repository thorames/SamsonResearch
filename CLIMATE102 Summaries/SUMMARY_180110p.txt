And so what's happening is, even though we're freezing here on the surface, it's actually warm in the upper atmosphere, so we're able to form rain. It's emitting, typically, a range of wavelengths, but the max wavelength is gonna be inversely proportional to a constant here, divided by a temperature. Is basically the wavelength of different objects-- again, is proportional, or the max wavelength emitted is proportional to the temperature. But basically, the wavelength is-- again, max wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. And again, this is the type of question that Perry loves to ask, especially on exams. Now, latent heat is a fun one, because it's basically the release of energy from transition of phases of water. That is latent heat-- is basically the release of energy through a phase transition of water in the atmosphere. The sunlight comes in, hits the atmosphere, and shoots right back out. So the surface of the Earth has a temperature, so that's emitting in the longwave radiation spectrum. So now you're taking water away from the surface, moving it in there, and now it can condense in the atmosphere, and release latent heat.
