And as you're gonna be-- your job to interpret to what degree, in that clip, the movie actually is reasonably sound in its scientific representation of the extreme weather event. Which way is the wind blowing? From right to left. So, yes, the wind should be blowing from left to right in this image with that kind of storm. That's not really fair, is it? The real question would be, 'Which state averages the most tornadoes per 10,000 square miles? So, per square area. The state with the most tornadoes per 10,000 square miles. Florida has more tornadoes per square mile than any other state, coming in at like 12 tornadoes per 10,000 square miles. On top of that, we are na-- now able to actually identify tornadoes without anybody even seeing them. And so we can identify clouds where the rotation is inside the cloud, strong enough to be producing a tornado, without anybody getting a picture of it or even-- maybe even seeing it. But the fact is that the number of deaths-- this is the number of people who die per million. But until roughly 1930 or so, the number of deaths from tornadoes per million was somewhere-- what's that? This is a logarithmic scale, so it's about two deaths per million people, was the rate per year.
