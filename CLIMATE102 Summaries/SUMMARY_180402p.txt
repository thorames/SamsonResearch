And if you somehow could force the air upwards at this point, the air would be cooling at the dry adiabatic lapse rate until about this spot, where the temperature-- if it's lifted, the temperature and the dew point then becomes the same. And you know by now, that anything that makes the lapse rate steeper is gonna make the air less stable. And as we lift it, it's now warmer than the air that's already there. So now it's gonna cool at the moist adiabatic lapse rate, going up further here. In the upper atmosphere, here, there's a jet stream. You got the air in Albuquerque, which is 95 degrees and the dew point is-- I mean, humidity is 15 percent. And that's sitting under the spot in the upper atmosphere where there's divergence happening. If you're in this part of the cloud, in the center part of the cloud, there's a heavy rain and good-- highly good chance that there's gonna be big hail falling inside there. There's sort of what's-- a little grayer air's near-- these are gonna be areas of heavy rain and hail, inside here. And here's a forward flank downdraft, and the rear flank downdraft.
