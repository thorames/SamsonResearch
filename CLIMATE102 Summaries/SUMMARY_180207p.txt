And with the Pacific High, there's gonna be air flow from the north here as this flows out of this high, pretty much down and along-- parallel to the coastline of California. But now, it's got-- it's in motion, and it gets pulled by the Coriolis force to its right. And this is called the 'Ekman spiral.' Now, the net result of that-- Ekman spiral-- is the-- whatever direction the wind is going in the Northern Hemisphere, the water's gonna move-- the surface water's going move 45 degrees-ish from that. If you're in the Southern Hemisphere, and the air is blowing parallel to the coastline, the air-- water's gonna get pulled to its left, instead of its right. So, what happens is that cold water is there, the fisheries are good, and then-- and then, periodically, the cold water goes away. You're gonna have to be able to explain back why-- you know, what-- what El Ni–o causes in terms of weather effects. You know the Hadley cell is rising air, sinking at 30 degrees, on Northern and Southern Hemispheres. So now, the air is moving from west to east, rising, and then back from east to west in the upper atmosphere. We do know this: is when that area of the world gets warmer, because the El Ni–o is happening, it causes weather change in North America. When El Ni–o happens, precipitation patterns change systematically in North America and other parts of the world.
