Where in that video do you see the clouds generally moving from the east? Near the North Pole, near Michigan, near Florida, or near the Equator? Alright. Given that, if they have the same pressure, that means there's the same number of molecules on top of each of these cities, right? That's pressure. Pressure gradient is created in the upper atmosphere, and if there's a pressure gradient, there must be wind. Upstairs, the air is gonna wanna flow from land offshore. Alright, let's play that-- well, in fact, let's ask the question here. Differential heating is gonna cause the air to move from the hot column to the cold column. So, you'd have this-- and it's poorly drawn; I appreciate that-- in the upper atmosphere, the blue arrows represent the air flowing from warm to cold. The red arrows here indicate the air flowing back along the surface, from the cold to the warm. Here's the deserts here in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Gobi Desert, and Southwest United States. I bring that up because when do we have maximum hurricanes and tropical storms? It's typically going to be late August, early September.
