If you hit that cue ball against the side of the-- wall of the pool table, it generally comes off at roughly the same speed it hit the pool table at, right? Except for the friction of the table surface, it'd come off at the same speed. How does that actual lapse rate compare to these theoretical lapse rates? And so this busy diagram here illustrates that. So we're gonna be comparing how does the actual lapse rate compare with the dry adiabatic lapse rate, as we move forward here. And it's 30 degrees at the ground, and it's 19 degrees at one kilometer, and eight degrees at two kilometers, minus three at four. And now it's warmer than the air that's already there. The dew point will drop at two degrees per kilometer. It's gonna drop at a rate of two degrees per kilometer, so i-- start at two, it's also gonna be zero when we get to one kilometer. The dew point is gonna be warming at six degrees per kilometer if it's saturated, but again, at two degrees per kilometer if it's not saturated. Most of our graphs would have both of these-- the dry and moist adiabatic lapse rates on them, so you could quickly identify the layers in the atmosphere where temperature is-- where air is unstable. The air is now gonna be warming at the dry adiabatic lapse rate on the downwind side.
