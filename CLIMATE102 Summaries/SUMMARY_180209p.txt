One cell becomes dominant, and then you get two cells again. Pressure gradient force is always acting towards low pressure. The stronger the wind speed, the stronger the Coriolis force pulling it to the right. There's a low and there's, you know, isobars wrapped around it, and the wind is blowing around-- in a counterclockwise way-- the low pressure system. Because of the warmth in the south in causing this gradient in pressure, which leads to this geostrophic wind in the upper atmosphere. Air's always-- the pressure gradient force is always towards low pressure. Gets pulled by the Coriolis force, and winds up also blowing from the west. The pressure gradient force is always acting-- the blue lines here are always acting towards low pressure, no matter where you are in this picture. The pressure gradient force is acting towards this somewhat higher area here. The air wants to move from the higher pressure on the East Coast towards the lower pressure up there.
